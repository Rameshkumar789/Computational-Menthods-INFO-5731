0,Policy packages as potential routes to urban road pricing in the UK,"This paper focuses on urban road pricing as a demand management policy that is often regarded as radical and generally unacceptable. Road pricing often gets delayed or abandoned due to low acceptability. This may be due to the fact that complex interactions and drivers of change affect road transport management and require cooperation within implementation networks. The implementation network is a group of people (referred to as partners and actors) who co-ordinate the introduction of policy tools. The drivers of change include any internal or external influences that have an effect on the time, place, or ‘shape’ of the policy measures being introduced. Demand management measures that focus on 'sustainable transport' usually address a limited set of objectives and are often implemented alone i.e. are not necessarily combined with other policy measures. When combined with other measures, it is not always clear whether the multiple interactions between policy tools and implementation networks have been sufficiently considered. Examples of ongoing implementation of policy package in the UK are the support of road pricing initiatives combined with public transport improvements by the Transport Innovation Fund. The objectives of the paper are twofold. First, we present a review of the UK urban road pricing situation. Second, we contrast the emerging issues against six key implementation factors. The analysis of three existing UK road pricing examples - London, Edinburgh and Durham – shows the importance of combining policy tools. Furthermore, through the above examples and theoretical arguments, we emphasise the additional need of creating and maintaining strong networks when implementing policy packages"
1,Nitric oxide formation during cortical spreading depression is critical for rapid subsequent recovery of ionic homeostasis,"NoCortical spreading depression (CSD) is a temporary disruption of local ionic homeostasis that propagates slowly across the cerebral cortex. Cortical spreading depression promotes lesion progression in experimental stroke, and may contribute to the initiation of migraine attacks. The purpose of this study was to investigate the roles of the marked increase of nitric oxide (NO) formation that occurs with CSD. Microdialysis electrodes were implanted in the cortex of anesthetized rats to perform the following operations within the same region: (1) elicitation of CSD by perfusion of high K+ medium; (2) recording of CSD elicitation; (3) application of the NO synthase inhibitor, NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME); and (4) recording of dialysate pH changes. The primary effect of L-NAME (0.3 to 3.0 mmol/L in the perfusion medium) was a marked widening of individual CSD wave, resulting essentially from a delayed initiation of the repolarization phase. This change was due to NO synthase inhibition because it was not observed with the inactive isomer D-NAME, and was reversed by L-arginine. This effect did not appear to be linked to the suppression of a sustained, NO-mediated vascular change associated with the superposition of NO synthase inhibition on high levels of extracellular K+. The delayed initiation of repolarization with local NO synthase inhibition may reflect the suppression of NO-mediated negative feedback mechanisms acting on neuronal or glial processes involved in CSD genesis. However, the possible abrogation of a very brief, NO-mediated vascular change associated with the early phase of CSD cannot be ruled out"
2,"MMP-10 is overexpressed, proteolytically active and a potential target for therapeutic intervention in human lung carcinomas","NoMatrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-mediated degradation of the extracellular matrix is a major factor for tumor development and expansion. This study analysed MMP-10 protein expression and activity in human lung tumors of various grade, stage, and type to address the relationship between MMP-10 and tumor characteristics and to evaluate MMP-10 as a therapeutic target in non small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Unlike the majority of MMPs, MMP-10 was located in the tumor mass as opposed to tumor stroma. MMP-10 protein was observed at low levels in normal human lung tissues and at significantly higher levels in all types of NSCLC. No correlation was observed between MMP-10 protein expression and tumor type, stage, or lymph node invasion. To discriminate between active and inactive forms of MMP-10 in samples of human NSCLC, we have developed an ex vivo fluorescent assay. Measurable MMP-10 activity was detected in 42 of 50 specimens of lung cancer and only 2 of 10 specimens of histologically normal lung tissue. No relationship was observed between MMP-10 activity levels and clinicopathologic characteristics. Our results suggest that MMP-10 is expressed and active at high levels in human NSCLC compared to normal lung tissues, and, as such, is a potential target for the development of novel therapeutics for lung cancer treatment"
3,Beacons of Excellence in Stress Prevention,"NoThis report describes the work of Robertson Cooper Ltd and UMIST to identify good practice in stress
prevention and then identify organisations within the UK that could be called beacons of excellence in
comparison to this model. Part one of this report summarises and draws conclusions from all of the
substantive academic studies on stress prevention over the last decade and uses this information, as
well as advice gained from a panel of international experts, to develop a comprehensive stress
prevention model. Part two of the report uses this model to describe examples of stress prevention
practices that Robertson Cooper Ltd has identified within a wide range of UK organisations. Case
studies are presented for each aspect of the good practice model. Examples of real documentation and
organisational practice are presented.Health and Safety Executive (HSE"
4,"The use of biomedicine, complementary and alternative medicine, and ethnomedicine for the treatment of epilepsy among people of South Asian origin in the UK","Studies have shown that a significant proportion of people with epilepsy use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). CAM use is known to vary between different ethnic groups and cultural contexts; however, little attention has been devoted to inter-ethnic differences within the UK population. We studied the use of biomedicine, complementary and alternative medicine, and ethnomedicine in a sample of people with epilepsy of South Asian origin living in the north of England.
Interviews were conducted with 30 people of South Asian origin and 16 carers drawn from a sampling frame of patients over 18 years old with epilepsy, compiled from epilepsy registers and hospital databases. All interviews were tape-recorded, translated if required and transcribed. A framework approach was adopted to analyse the data.
All those interviewed were taking conventional anti-epileptic drugs. Most had also sought help from traditional South Asian practitioners, but only two people had tried conventional CAM. Decisions to consult a traditional healer were taken by families rather than by individuals with epilepsy. Those who made the decision to consult a traditional healer were usually older family members and their motivations and perceptions of safety and efficacy often differed from those of the recipients of the treatment. No-one had discussed the use of traditional therapies with their doctor. The patterns observed in the UK mirrored those reported among people with epilepsy in India and Pakistan.
The health care-seeking behaviour of study participants, although mainly confined within the ethnomedicine sector, shared much in common with that of people who use global CAM. The appeal of traditional therapies lay in their religious and moral legitimacy within the South Asian community, especially to the older generation who were disproportionately influential in the determination of treatment choices. As a second generation made up of people of Pakistani origin born in the UK reach the age when they are the influential decision makers in their families, resort to traditional therapies may decline. People had long experience of navigating plural systems of health care and avoided potential conflict by maintaining strict separation between different sectors. Health care practitioners need to approach these issues with sensitivity and to regard traditional healers as potential allies, rather than competitors or quacks"
5,Increasing the frequency of hand washing by healthcare workers does not lead to commensurate reductions in staphylococcal infection in a hospital ward,"Hand hygiene is generally considered to be the most important measure that can be applied to prevent the spread of healthcare-associated infection (HAI). Continuous emphasis on this intervention has lead to the widespread opinion that HAI rates can be greatly reduced by increased hand hygiene compliance alone. However, this assumes that the effectiveness of hand hygiene is not constrained by other factors and that improved compliance in excess of a given level, in itself, will result in a commensurate reduction in the incidence of HAI. However, several researchers have found the law of diminishing returns to apply to hand hygiene, with the greatest benefits occurring in the first 20% or so of compliance, and others have demonstrated that poor cohorting of nursing staff profoundly influences the effectiveness of hand hygiene measures. Collectively, these findings raise intriguing questions about the extent to which increasing compliance alone can further reduce rates of HAI. 
In order to investigate these issues further, we constructed a deterministic Ross-Macdonald model and applied it to a hypothetical general medical ward. In this model the transmission of staphylococcal infection was assumed to occur after contact with the transiently colonized hands of HCWs, who, in turn, acquire contamination only by touching colonized patients. The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of imperfect hand cleansing on the transmission of staphylococcal infection and to identify, whether there is a limit, above which further hand hygiene compliance is unlikely to be of benefit.
The model demonstrated that if transmission is solely via the hands of HCWs, it should, under most circumstances, be possible to prevent outbreaks of staphylococcal infection from occurring at a hand cleansing frequencies <50%, even with imperfect hand hygiene. The analysis also indicated that the relationship between hand cleansing efficacy and frequency is not linear - as efficacy decreases, so the hand cleansing frequency required to ensure R0<1 increases disproportionately.
Although our study confirmed hand hygiene to be an effective control measure, it demonstrated that the law of diminishing returns applies, with the greatest benefit derived from the first 20% or so of compliance. Indeed, our analysis suggests that there is little benefit to be accrued from very high levels of hand cleansing and that in most situations compliance >40% should be enough to prevent outbreaks of staphylococcal infection occurring, if transmission is solely via the hands of HCWs. Furthermore we identified a non-linear relationship between hand cleansing efficacy and frequency, suggesting that it is important to maximise the efficacy of the hand cleansing process"
6,Functional evidence for cone-specific connectivity in the human retina,"NoPhysiological studies of colour vision have not yet resolved the controversial issue of how chromatic opponency is constructed at a neuronal level. Two competing theories, the cone-selective hypothesis and the random-wiring hypothesis, are currently equivocal to the architecture of the primate retina. In central vision, both schemes are capable of producing colour opponency due to the fact that receptive field centres receive input from a single bipolar cell ¿ the so called `private line arrangement¿. However, in peripheral vision this single-cone input to the receptive field centre is lost, so that any random cone connectivity would result in a predictable reduction in the quality of colour vision. Behavioural studies thus far have indeed suggested a selective loss of chromatic sensitivity in peripheral vision. We investigated chromatic sensitivity as a function of eccentricity for the cardinal chromatic (L/M and S/(L + M)) and achromatic (L + M) pathways, adopting stimulus size as the critical variable. Results show that performance can be equated across the visual field simply by a change of scale (size). In other words, there exists no qualitative loss of chromatic sensitivity across the visual field. Critically, however, the quantitative nature of size dependency for each of the cardinal chromatic and achromatic mechanisms is very specific, reinforcing their independence in terms of anatomy and genetics. Our data provide clear evidence for a physiological model of primate colour vision that retains chromatic quality in peripheral vision, thus supporting the cone-selective hypothesis"
7,The Chittagong story: studies on the ecology of rat floods and bamboo masting,"Rodent population outbreaks due to the 50-year cycle of gregarious flowering and seed masting of Melocanna baccifera were first noted in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) of Bangladesh during the crop production cycle of 2008. The wave of flowering has steadily moved southward through the region each year, with seed masting still occurring in some areas of the CHT during 2010. Because of

a lack of surveillance, it is not yet known whether all Melocanna bamboo forests across the region have now initiated flowering. Ecological surveys carried out

during the masting event have provided some preliminary evidence that nearly all rodent species are able to exploit Melocanna bamboo seeds as a food resource, with nearly 30% of the seed fallen in forests damaged by rodents.

Breeding potential of the predominant species found, Rattus rattus, appears to confirm that aseasonal breeding occurs due to the abundant supply of bamboo seed during masting events. These preliminary results obtained from ongoing

research surveys are discussed in the context of the management response to the regional famine triggered by the severe crop damage caused by rodent population outbreaks"

9,Mass-screening techniques for the early selection of disease resistance in chickpea (Cicer arietinum),"Host plant resistance offers the most sustainable and effective disease management option to combat diseases in chickpea. In this chapter, we briefly describe the distribution, economic importance and symptoms of the most important diseases of chickpea including Ascochyta blight, Botrytis grey mould, Fusarium wilt, dry root rot, collar rot, black root rot and stem rot. Screening methods developed by different research institutes to select  germplasm and breeding lines resistant against these diseases are reviewed. A variety of field, greenhouse, growth room and laboratory screening techniques along with disease rating scale to facilitate the identification of resistant breeding material are discussed in detail. Coloured illustrations for each technique are provided as well as extensive lists of available resistant sources against all diseases. For the selection of sources of resistance to various diseases in chickpea, and for breeding high yielding cultivars with improved levels of resistance, this chapter describes current techniques for the simultaneous screening of a large number of chickpea

plants"
10,Rodent outbreaks: ecology and impacts,"The impacts of rodents in both developing and developed countries are legendary. Myths and dogma about rodents and their population outbreaks abound. They are imbedded in the culture and language of many societies. In many instances, it is the acceptance of these outbreaks by society that is our greatest challenge. The reason these episodic outbreaks become etched in the socio-cultural psyche from the sparsely populated uplands of Laos to the considerably more affluent agricultural lands of Europe is that the impacts are often staggering - economically, socially, and even politically. The book is a collation of contributions from Asia, Africa, Oceania (Australia and New Zealand), Europe, and North America. The advent of ecologically based rodent management has stimulated the progress summarized in this book. The contributions provide a modern appraisal to an age-old problem through a better understanding of the mechanisms that lead to rodent outbreaks, why rodent population numbers increase under different circumstances, and the impact of outbreaks in a range of different agroecosystems and native forests in different parts of the world. This is an encouraging progress report driven by scientists passionate about rodents, about people, about conservation, and about improving our knowledge of these species and the ecosystems they inhabit. And, in a novel twist, there is an appendix of recipes for preparing rat meat. You will be more than tempted to try one of these dishes the next time you travel in Asia or Africa"
11,Chemostratigraphy of Upper Carboniferous (Pennsylvanian) sequences from the Southern North Sea (United Kingdom),"Important gas reservoirs occur in the Upper Carboniferous coal measures and red beds of the Southern North Sea. The thick red beds of the Boulton and Ketch formations are difficult to correlate, due to poor internal seismic definition, repetitive e-log signatures, and their barren nature. Although the underlying coal measures of the Westoe, Cleaver, and Caister Formations have better seismic resolution and contain palynomorphs, coals that die out laterally and the lack of diagnostic taxa over certain intervals contribute to their correlation being problematical. However, the application of chemostratigraphy to more than sixty wells from numerous fields in UK Quadrants 44 and 49, as well as from Dutch sector Blocks E, F, and K, allows the establishment of an independent, robust, detailed correlation framework

for the aforesaid red beds and coal measures.

Presented in this paper are correlative chemostratigraphic reference sections for the Caister, Westoe, Cleaver, Ketch, Boulton, and Step Graben formations. The chemostratigraphic zonations erected for these formations are based on variations in silty claystone geochemistry that can be tied to changes in provenance, climate, and depositional environment. In addition, the zonations are supported by stratigraphic changes in sandstone and coal geochemistry, the geochemical correlation of tonsteins and marine bands, and the recognition of different types of paleosol in the above formations.

The chemostratigraphic correlation framework enables specific broad intervals (""packages"") to be correlated between fields and is also used to constrain seismic correlations with a view to highlighting potential exploration targets. Furthermore, the same framework allows

much thinner intervals (""units"" and ""subunits"") to be correlated within fields: these smaller-scale correlations enhance reservoir correlations with respect to the development of fields such as Boulton, Schooner, Tyne, Ketch, and Topaz. In addition to using inorganic

geochemical data to characterize and correlate sedimentological packages, data can also used to identify and correlate marker horizons and surfaces (tonsteins, coals, marine bands, major paleosols), which may be highly correlative low-diachrony surfaces, which greatly enhance

the overall validity of the stratigraphic correlation scheme"

16,"Values, principles and integrity: academic and professional standards in higher education","A brief narrative description of the journal article, document, or resource.	This paper is based mainly on responses--nearly 300--to a web-based survey of academic staff in UK higher education. The survey examined their personal and professional values and their views on the values that should underpin higher education. Their perceptions of current reality in terms of national policy and processes and of institutional management expectations, with examples provided of events that disturbed them, raise questions about the longer term health of higher education as it has been understood. The project was seen as a pilot aiming to provoke debate about how well traditional values and standards ""fit"" with mass levels of higher education provision, and government emphases on the economic role of higher education. The findings are set in a theoretical context drawing on models by Clark (1983), Becher and Kogan (1992) and the author (McNay, 1995, 2005a"
17,Innovations in pay and grading in NHS trusts,"This report examines innovations in pay and grading in 10 NHS trusts in England using data collected from March 2000 to January 2001, ie prior to the implementation of Agenda for Change. These 10 trusts, which varied in size, function, and location, were selected primarily to illustrate a variety of different approaches to pay and grading. The research utilised a qualitative methodology, with interviews of managers on a one to one basis, group interviews with lay union representatives, focus groups with staff and the inspection of documents. This study focused on four questions:

• Did local pay resolve the problems associated with Whitley?

• What were the consequences of local pay?

• Were the trusts’ pay systems introduced in line with 'new pay' ideas and current trends in reward management?

• What factors were critical to the success of developing and implementing local pay systems in NHS trusts"
18,Does it work? evaluating a new pay system,"This report focuses on the evaluation of the impact of new pay systems in large, unionised multi-site organisations by the organisations themselves. Evaluation of the effectiveness of a pay system, however, does not take place in a vacuum and relates to the aims and objectives of the pay system concerned. Moreover, evaluation is not an end in itself. It is, therefore, relevant to consider if any further steps were taken as a result of evaluation. Accordingly our research questions were:

• What were the aims and objectives of organisations when introducing new pay arrangements?

• What data did organisations collect and review to inform their evaluation?

• What steps have organisations taken as a result of their evaluation?

We re-appraised our data from 10 NHS trusts in England which had introduced some innovations in pay and grading in the 1990s. Additionally, we looked at seven multi-site unionised organisations outside the NHS in both the public and private sectors, which had recently made changes to their reward systems, carrying out interviews and inspecting documents.

The main output is a template for the evaluation of Agenda for Change by NHS organisations"

The objective is to identify good practice as well as barriers to women’s full contribution to the labour market in South East (SE) England. The research questions are:

• How does the labour market position of women in the SE region compare with that of men in the region and with that of women nationally?

• What policies and practices do employers in South East England adopt in respect of gender equality?

• What barriers do employers and women employees in South-East England identify in respect of gender and employment"
20,Adopting sustainable soil management: the role of socio-economic factors,"The sustainable management of soils is crucial to enable the long term use of the various soil functions. Although soil degradation caused by agriculture is a process defined by technical, climatic, and bio-physical factors, there is recognition that the underlying causes are to be found

in the socio-economic, political and cultural context in which farmers operate. In Europe, farmers’ decision-making on farm management is strongly influenced by agricultural policies and economic incentives.

This paper aims to review and summarize findings of existing studies on the role of socioeconomic factors that influence farmers and other land managers’ adoption of soil conservation practices with a focus on the European situation"

Recent research has indicated that different student groups have different degree and employment outcomes, this research examines how different student groups engage with extra-curricular activities and what effect these activities have on their degree and graduate outcomes.



It examines what extra-curricular activities students participate in and whether different groups have preferences for different types of activities (i.e. are there patterns of participation in certain activities by certain groups of students) and if so what impact does this patterning have on graduate employment potential. Extra-curricular activities are broadly defined in this research, such as part-time work, involvement in University union clubs and societies, (and different types of clubs and societies, cultural, sporting and other), other University related activities such as volunteering, class representation, etc. and other activities outside of University life, such as family commitments and community activitie"

24,The reporting behaviours of student nurses who have experienced verbal abuse,"Background: There is evidence that student nurses are vulnerable to experiencing verbal abuse from a variety of sources and under-reporting of verbal abuse is prevalent throughout the nursing profession.

The objective of the study is to explore the reporting behaviours of student nurses who have experienced verbal abuse.

Method: For this study a definition of verbal abuse was adopted from current Department of Health (England) guidelines. Questionnaires were distributed in 2005 to a convenience sample of 156 third year nursing students from one pre-registration nursing programme in England. A total of 114 questionnaires were returned, giving an overall response rate of 73.0%.

Results: Fifty one students (44.7% of responses) reported verbal abuse; all of these completed the section exploring reporting behaviours. The incidents involved patients in thirty three cases (64.7%); eight cases (15.7%) involved visitors or relatives and ten cases (19.6%) involved other healthcare workers. Thirty two students (62.7%) stated that they did report the incident of verbal abuse they

experienced and nineteen (37.3%) of respondents reported that they did not. Only four incidents developed from an oral report to being formally documented. There was a statistically significant association (P = 0.003) between the focus of verbal abuse (patient/visitor or colleague) and the respondents reporting practices with respondents experiencing verbal abuse from colleagues less likely to report incidents. Most frequent feelings following experiences of verbal abuse from colleagues were feelings of embarrassment and hurt/shock. Most frequent consequences of experiencing verbal abuse from patients or relatives were feeling embarrassed and feeling sorry for the abuser. When comparing non reporters with reporters, the most frequent feelings of non reporters were embarrassment and hurt and reporters, embarrassment and feeling sorry for the

abuser. When considering levels of support after the incident the mean rating score of respondents who reported the incident was 5.40 (standard deviation 2.89) and of those that did not, 4.36 (standard deviation 2.87) which was not statistically significant (p = 0.220).

Conclusions: 1. Not documenting experiences of verbal abuse formally in writing is a prevalent phenomenon within the sample studied and reporting practices are inconsistent.

2. Both Higher Education Institutions and health care providers should consider emphasising formal reporting and documenting of incidents of verbal abuse during student nurse training and access to formal supportive services should be promoted.

3. Effective incident reporting processes and analysis of these reports can lead to an increased awareness of how to avoid negative interactions in the workplace and how to deal with incidents effectively"
25,Assessing the suitability of ship design for human factors issues associated with evacuation and normal operations,Evaluating ship layout for human factors (HF) issues using simulation software such as maritimeEXODUS can be a long and complex process. The analysis requires the identification of relevant evaluation scenarios; encompassing evacuation and normal operations; the development of appropriate measures which can be used to gauge the performance of crew and vessel and finally; the interpretation of considerable simulation data. In this paper we present a systematic and transparent methodology for assessing the HF performance of ship design which is both discriminating and diagnostic. The methodology is demonstrated using two variants of a hypothetical naval ship

We first outline the core algorithms and place it in the context of the multilevel refinement paradigm. We then look at issues relating to its use as a tool for parallel processing and, in particular, partitioning in parallel. Since its first release in 1995, JOSTLE has been used for many mesh-based parallel scientific computing applications and so we also outline some enhancements such as multiphase mesh-partitioning, heterogeneous mapping and partitioning to optimise subdomain shap"
27,A computational study of the characteristics of aircraft post-crash fires,"Full-scale furnished cabin fires have been studied experimentally for the purpose of characterising the post-crash cabin fire environment by the US Federal Aviation

Administration for many years. In this paper the Computational Fluid Dynamics fire field model SMARTFIRE is used to simulate one of these fires conducted in the C-133 test facility in order to provide further validation of the computational approach and the SMARTFIRE software. The experiment involves exposing the interior cabin materials to an external fuel fire, opening only one exit at the far end of the cabin (the same side as the rupture) for ventilation, and noting the subsequent spread of the external fire to the cabin interior and the onset of flashover at approximately 210 seconds. Through this analysis, the software is shown to be in good agreement with the experimental data, producing reasonable agreement with the fire dynamics prior to flashover and producing a reasonable prediction of the

flashover time i.e. 225 seconds. The paper then proceeds to utilize the model to examine the impact on flashover time of the extent of cabin furnishings and cabin ventilation provided by available exit"
28,Emotional coherence in educational leadership: the importance of the personal in interpreting and sustaining primary school headship,"This thesis examines how primary headteachers experience, and talk about, emotion and meaning in their daily interactions, and sets out to understand further how the affective impacts on their leadership. It presents a reflective journey into the affective world of the primary headteacher, concentrating on the personal side of headship. It argues that primary headship is reliant on the personal emotional quality of the headteacher, and at the same time a quality of the social relationships in the school. By using an iterative process, the research argues that emotion and leadership are closely tied together, and this is of crucial importance in creating, modifying and sustaining both the headteacher and the emotional coherence of the whole school. The research draws on the headteachers’ own reflections on emotions as well as the influence of their life history, school context and emotional epiphanies. The affective is examined firstly by exploring the literature outside the educational leadership and management field that deals with emotion. This leads to an examination of the metaphor of emotional textures. Then, using qualitative methodology, this metaphor is used to discuss and draw upon on a small-scale study of primary headteachers to discuss the reality in the mind of the participants. Observation is then used as an analytical tool to develop understanding of the need for emotional coherence in primary school headship. The concept of a personal leadership narrative is developed to show not only that an individual’s complexity is not adequately served by competency approaches to emotion, but also that primary school headship is a complex synergy of emotion and leadership. Finally, the implications of the findings for adding to leadership theory and practice are discussed"
29,Towards a pedagogical framework for the teaching of controversial socio-scientific issues to secondary school students in the age range 14-19,"Teaching controversial socio-scientific issues presents a significant challenge to teachers because these issues are often based on complex but tentative scientific evidence, and differences between contending parties reflect political, socio-economic and ethical considerations. This thesis aims to develop a realisable pedagogy, underpinned by a theoretical framework, to address such controversial issues. The framework draws on three separate but interwoven strands: McLaughlin’s formulation of nine ‘levels of disagreement’ which conceptualises controversy in a democratic and pluralistic society, the levels ranging from differences based on evidence to differences in worldviews; the ‘communicative virtues’ in which participants need to be schooled to support open dialogue; and Bruner’s ‘modes of thought’ in which protagonists in a controversy aim to convince their interlocutors through narrative and logico-scientific modes. This pedagogical framework operates through constructions of the school-society interface ranging from science as authoritative to science as negotiable. 83 teachers, from 21 different secondary schools and further education colleges in England and Wales, were interviewed about their experiences of teaching controversial socio-scientific issues. Empirical indicators drawn from the teachers’ narratives were mapped onto the framework to construct a picture of current pedagogy. Findings point to a need to support teachers in focusing on specific case studies, particularly those which draw on evidence and its associated logical procedures, to encourage teachers to explicitly draw on student narratives and to educate students in the communicative virtues. Opportunities and limitations are discussed in locating the teaching of controversial socio-scientific issues in the curriculum and in further characterising pedagogy and learning for future research"

35,Factors influencing the success of computer mediated communication (CMC) environments in university teaching: a review and case study,"Despite its potential benefits, the effectiveness of CMC when used to support learning in higher education is very variable, making it important to identify those factors which best predict successful implementations. A review of the literature from the past few years, presented in the first half of this paper, suggests that, consistent with Activity Theory (Leont'ev, 1978), the critical factors are those which provide a context and rationale for online communication by helping users to establish a shared purpose. However, generating empirical support for this hypothesis presents two kinds of methodological problem: specifying the methods and measures necessary to discern the existence and impact of shared purpose; and dealing with the difficulties of making controlled comparisons in this area. The second half of the paper illustrates, via an implementation case study, something of how these methodological problems might be resolved, and presents evidence in favour of the central importance of shared purpose"
36,The effects of adult guidance and peer discussion on the development of children's representations: evidence from the training of pedestrian skills,"It was hypothesised that practical training is effective in improving children's pedestrian skills because adult scaffolding and peer discussion during training specifically promote E3 level representation (linguistically-encoded, experientially-grounded, generalisable knowledge), as defined by Karmiloff-Smith's (1992) representational redescription (RR) model. Two studies were conducted to examine in detail the impact of this social input, in the context of simulation-based training in roadside search skills. Five- to eight-year-olds were pre-tested on ability to detect relevant road crossing features. They then participated in four training sessions designed to promote attunement to these, under peer discussion condition vs adult guidance conditions (Study 1), and adult-child vs adult-group conditions (Study 2). Performance at post-test was compared to that of controls who underwent no training. Study 1 found that children in the adult guidance condition improved significantly more than those in the peer discussion or control conditions, and this improvement was directly attributable to appropriation of E3 level representations from adult dialogue. Study 2 found that progress was greater still when adult scaffolding was supplemented by peer discussion, with E3 level representation attributable to children's exploration of conflicting ideas. The implications of these findings for the RR model and for practical road safety education are discussed"

38,Grouping practices in the primary school: what influences change?,"During the 1990s, there was considerable emphasis on promoting particular kinds of pupil grouping as a means of raising educational standards. This survey of 2000 primary schools explored the extent to which schools had changed their grouping practices in responses to this, the nature of the changes made and the reasons for those changes. Forty eight percent of responding schools reported that they had made no change. Twenty two percent reported changes because of the literacy hour, 2% because of the numeracy hour, 7% because of a combination of these and 21% for other reasons. Important influences on decisions about the types of grouping adopted were related to pupil learning and differentiation, teaching, the implementation of the national literacy strategy, practical issues and school self-evaluation"
39,Secondary school pupils' preferences for different types of structured grouping practices,"The aim of this paper is to explore pupils’ preferences for particular types of grouping practices an area neglected in earlier research focusing on the personal and social outcomes of ability grouping. The sample comprised over 5,000 year 9 pupils (aged 13-14 years) in 45 mixed secondary comprehensive schools in England. The schools represented three levels of ability grouping in the lower school (years 7 to 9). Pupils responded to a questionnaire which explored the types of grouping that they preferred and the reasons for their choices. The majority of pupils preferred setting, although this was mediated by their set placement, type of school, socio-economic status and gender. The key reason given for this preference was that it enabled work to be matched to learning needs. The paper considers whether there are other ways of achieving this avoiding the negative social and personal outcomes of setting for some pupils"
40,Secondary school pupils' satisfaction with their ability grouping placements,"There has been little research exploring pupils’ satisfaction with their ability group placement. This paper explores the extent to which pupils are happy with their placement, and the reasons they give for wanting to move to another class or set. The sample comprised over 5,000 year 9 pupils (aged 13-14 years) in 45 mixed secondary comprehensive schools in England. The schools represented three levels of ability grouping in the lower school (years 7 to 9). Pupils responded to a questionnaire which explored their current set placement, their satisfaction with it, and their reasons for wanting to change. A substantial proportion of pupils expressed a wish to change set, most, but not all, in an upward direction, mainly because the level of work was inappropriate. The implications for ability grouping practices in schools are discussed"
41,Number skills and knowledge in children with specific language impairment,"The number skills of groups of 7 to 9 year old children with specific language impairment (SLI) attending mainstream or special schools are compared with an age and nonverbal reasoning matched group (AC), and a younger group matched on oral language comprehension. The SLI groups performed below the AC group on every skill. They also showed lower working memory functioning and had received lower levels of instruction. Nonverbal reasoning, working memory functioning, language comprehension, and instruction accounted for individual variation in number skills to differing extents depending on the skill. These factors did not explain the differences between SLI and AC groups on most skills"
42,Do calendrical savants use calculation to answer date questions? : a functional magnetic resonance imaging study,None
43,Why and how people of limited intelligence become calendrical calculators,"Calendrical calculation is the rare talent of naming the days of the week for dates in the past and future. Calendrical savants are people with low measured intelligence who have this talent. This paper reviews evidence and speculation about why people become calendrical savants and how they answer date questions. Most savants are known to have intensively studied the calendar and show superior memory for calendrical information. As a result they may answer date questions either from recalling calendars or by using strategies that exploit calendrical regularities. While people of average or superior intelligence may become calendrical calculators through internalising formulae, the arithmetical demands of the formulae make them unlikely as bases for the talents of calendrical savants. We attempt to identify the methods used by a sample of 10 savants. None rely on an internalised formula. Some use strategies based on calendrical regularities probably in conjunction with memory for a range of years. For the rest a decision between use of regularities and recall of calendars cannot be made"
44,The skills and methods of calendrical savants,"Calendrical savants are people with considerable intellectual difficulties that have the unusual ability to name the weekdays for dates in the past and sometimes the future. Three criteria are proposed to distinguish savants whose skill depends on memorization from those who calculate: range of years, consistent deviation from the Gregorian calendar, and variation in latency with remoteness from the present. A study of 10 calendrical savants showed 5 met one or both of the criteria concerning range and deviation and 9 met the third criterion. The second study assessed their arithmetical abilities using tests of mental and written arithmetic. This broadly validated the attribution of calculation as the basis for some savants? skills. The results are discussed in relation to views that calendrical savants imply the existence of a modular mathematical intelligence or unconscious integer arithmetic"
45,"The relation between anger coping strategies, anger mood and somatic complaints in children and adolescents","Attempts to explain the experience of somatic complaints among children and adolescents suggest that they may in part result from the influence of particular strategies for coping with anger on the intensity and longevity of negative emotions. To explore these relationships British (n = 393) and Dutch (n = 299) children completed a modified version of the Behavioral Anger Response Questionnaire (BARQ), and two additional questionnaires assessing anger mood and somatic complaints. A hierarchical regression analysis showed that higher levels of anger mood, Social support-seeking and Rumination contributed to somatic complaints. Frequency of somatic complaints was not predicted by age. A tendency to repeatedly think or talk about an angering event as a way of coping seems to underlie the observed negative health effects. In addition, tentative support is given for a broader range of strategies to cope with anger than just the traditional anger-out and anger-in styles"
46,Children's understanding of mental states as causes of emotions,"Theory of Mind studies of emotion usually focus on children?s ability to predict other people's feelings. This study examined children?s spontaneous references to mental states in explaining others? emotions. Children (4-, 6- and 10-year-olds, n = 122) were told stories and asked to explain both typical and atypical emotional reactions of characters. Because atypical emotional reactions are unexpected, we hypothesized that children would be more likely to refer to mental states, such as desires and beliefs, in explaining them than when explaining typical emotions. From the development of lay theories of emotion, derived the prediction that older children would refer more often to mental states than younger children. The developmental shift from a desire-psychology to a belief-psychology led to the expectation that references to desires would increase at an earlier age than references to beliefs. Our findings confirmed these expectations only partly, because the nature of the emotion (happiness, anger, sadness or fear) interacted with these factors. Whereas anger, happiness and sadness mainly evoked desire references, fear evoked more belief references, even in four-year-olds. The fact that other factors besides age can also play an influential role in children?s mental state reasoning is discussed"
47,Social effects of collaborative learning in primary schools,"There is conflicting evidence on whether collaborative group work leads to improved classroom relations, and if so how. A before and after design was used to measure the impact on work and play relations of a collaborative learning programme involving 575 students 9-12 years old in single- and mixed-age classes across urban and rural schools. Data were also collected on student interactions and teacher ratings of their group-work skills. Analysis of variance revealed significant gains for both types of relation. Multilevel modelling indicated that better work relations were the product of improving group skills, which offset tensions produced by transactive dialogue, and this effect fed through in turn to play relations. Although before intervention rural children were familiar with each other neither this nor age mix affected outcomes. The results suggest the social benefits of collaborative learning are a separate outcome of group work, rather than being either a pre-condition for, or a direct consequence of successful activity, but that initial training in group skills may serve to enhance these benefits"
48,Validity and worth in the science curriculum: learning school science outside the laboratory,"It is widely acknowledged that there are problems with school science in many developed countries of the world. Such problems manifest themselves in a progressive decline in pupil enthusiasm for school science across the secondary age range and the fact that fewer students are choosing to study the physical sciences at higher levels and as careers. Responses to these developments have included proposals to reform the curriculum, pedagogy and the nature of pupil discussion in science lessons. We support such changes but argue from a consideration of the aims of science education that secondary school science is too rooted in the science laboratory; substantially greater use needs to be made of out-of-school sites for the teaching of science. Such usage should result in a school science education that is more valid and more motivating and is better at fulfilling defensible aims of school science education. Our contention is that laboratory-based school science teaching needs to be complemented by out-of-school science learning that draws on the actual world (e.g. through fieldtrips), the presented world (e.g. in science centres, botanic gardens, zoos and science museums) and the virtual worlds that are increasingly available through information and communications technologies (ICT)"
49,Choice-based secondary school admissions in England: social stratification and the distribution of educational outcomes,"This thesis uses the cohort of 2005 school-leavers in the National Pupil Database to present an economic analysis of the effects of secondary school admissions in England on pupil sorting and achievement. The first part of the thesis exploits the availability of pupil postcodes to examine the impact of current school admissions arrangements on residential and school stratification. It produces data from a thought experiment whereby pupils currently in schools are reallocated to a new school based strictly on proximity to school. Through this simulation the role of the housing market in producing socially stratified schooling can be identified. A survey of school admissions policies is used to show that religious (and to a lesser extent Foundation) schools have intakes that are signifcantly more advantaged than their local neighbourhood, and that they achieve these intakes through the use of explicit potentially selective admissions criteria. The second part of the thesis adds to evidence on whether policies intended to increase parental choice raise pupil achievement via competition between schools. Quantitative evidence on school competition in England is evaluated alongside the existing international literature. A regression discontinuity design is employed to examine the legacy effects of the Grant-Maintained schools policy on area-wide educational outcomes at age 16. Pupil fixed-effects test score growth models and historical instrumental variables are used to identify the causal impact of religious schools on their neighbouring schools. This econometric analysis fails to lend support to claims that encouraging schools to compete for pupils is a route to improving standards. The thesis concludes that the current English secondary school arrangements have resulted in a system that is stratified and inequitable, without measurable efficiency gains induced by competition between schools for pupils"

51,Mapping Children's Discussions of Evidence in Science to Assess Collaboration and Argumentation,"The research reported in this paper concerns the development of children's skills of interpreting and evaluating evidence in science. Previous studies have shown that school teaching often places limited emphasis on the development of these skills, which are necessary for children to engage in scientific debate and decision-making. The research, undertaken in the UK, involved four collaborative decision-making activities to stimulate group discussion, each was carried out with five groups of four children (10-11 years old). The research shows how the children evaluated evidence for possible choices and judged whether their evidence was sufficient to support a particular conclusion or the rejection of alternative conclusions. A mapping technique was developed to analyse the discussions and identify different ""levels"" of argumentation. The authors conclude that suitable collaborative activities that focus on the discussion of evidence can be developed to exercise children's ability to argue effectively in making decisions"
52,Attitudes towards science: a review of the literature and its implications,"This article offers a review of the major literature about attitudes to science and its implications over the past 20 years. It argues that the continuing decline in numbers choosing to study science at the point of choice requires a research focus on students? attitudes to science if the nature of the problem is to be understood and remediated. Starting from a consideration of what is meant by attitudes to science, it considers the problems inherent to their measurement and what is known about students' attitudes towards science and the many factors of influence such as gender, teachers, curricula, cultural and other variables. The literature itself points to the crucial importance of gender and the quality of teaching. Given the importance of the latter we argue that there is a greater need for research to identify those aspects of science teaching that make school science engaging for pupils. In particular, a growing body of research on motivation offers important pointers to the kind of classroom environment and activities that might raise pupils' interest in studying school science and a focus for future research"
53,Enhancing the Quality of Argumentation in School Science,"The research reported in this paper focussed on the design of learning environments that support the teaching and learning of argumentation in a scientific context. The research took place over two years between 1999 and 2001 in junior high schools in the greater London area. The research was conducted in two phases. In the first developmental phase, working with a group of 12 science teachers, the main emphasis was to develop sets of materials and strategies to support argumentation in the classroom and to assess teachers‘ development with teaching argumentation. Data were collected by videoing and audio recording the teachers attempts to implement these lessons at the beginning and end of the year. During this phase, analytical tools for evaluating the quality of argumentation were developed based on Toulmin‘s argument pattern. Analysis of the data shows that there was significant development in the majority of teachers use of argumentation across the year. Results indicate that the pattern of use of argumentation is teacher specific, as is the nature of the change. In the second phase of the project, teachers taught the experimental groups a minimum of nine lessons which involved socioscientific or scientific argumentation. In addition, these teachers taught similar lessons to a control group at the beginning and end of the year. Here the emphasis lay on assessing the progression in student capabilities with argumentation. Hence data were collected from several lessons of two groups of students engaging in argumentation. Using a framework for evaluating the nature of the discourse and its quality, the findings show that there was an improvement in the quality of students‘ argumentation. In addition, the research offers methodological developments for work in this field"
54,Learning to Teach Argumentation: Research and development in the science classroom,"The research reported in this study focuses on an investigation into the teaching of argumentation in secondary science classrooms. Over a one-year period, a group of 12 teachers from schools in the greater London area attended a series of workshops to develop materials and strategies to support the teaching of argumentation in scientific contexts. Data were collected at the beginning and end of the year by audio and video recording lessons where the teachers attempted to implement argumentation. To assess the quality of argumentation, analytical tools derived from Toulmin's argument pattern (TAP) were developed and applied to classroom transcripts. Analysis shows there was development in teachers' use of argumentation across the year. Results indicate that the pattern of use of argumentation is teacher-specific, as is the nature of change. To inform future professional development programmes, transcripts of five teachers, three showing a significant change and two no change, were analysed in more detail to identify features of teachers' oral contributions that facilitated and supported argumentation. The analysis showed that all teachers attempted to encourage a variety of processes involved in argumentation and that the teachers whose lessons included the highest quality of argumentation (TAP analysis) also encouraged higher order processes in their teaching. The analysis of teachers' facilitation of argumentation has helped to guide the development of in-service materials and to identify the barriers to learning in the professional development of less experienced teachers"
55,Argumentation in school science : Breaking the tradition of authoritative exposition through a pedagogy that promotes discussion and reasoning,"The value of argumentation in science education has become internationally recognised and has been the subject of many research studies in recent years. Successful introduction of argumentation activities in learning contexts involves extending teaching goals beyond the understanding of facts and concepts, to include an emphasis on cognitive and metacognitive processes, epistemic criteria and reasoning. The authors focus on the difficulties inherent in shifting a tradition of teaching from one dominated by authoritative exposition to one that is more dialogic, involving small-group discussion based on tasks that stimulate argumentation. The paper builds on previous research on enhancing the quality of argument in school science, to focus on how argumentation activities have been designed, with appropriate strategies, resources and modelling, for pedagogical purposes. The paper analyses design frameworks, their contexts and lesson plans, to evaluate their potential for enhancing reasoning through foregrounding the processes of argumentation. Examples of classroom dialogue where teachers adopt the frameworks/plans are analysed to show how argumentation processes are scaffolded. The analysis shows that several layers of interpretation are needed and these layers need to be aligned for successful implementation. The analysis serves to highlight the potential and limitations of the design frameworks"

57,Children's acquisition of science terms: simple exposure is insufficient,"The ability of school children (N = 233) to acquire new scientific vocabulary was examined. Children from two age groups (M = 4;8 and M = 6;5) were introduced to previously unknown words in an educational video. Word knowledge was assessed through accuracy and latency for production and comprehension over a nine month period. A draw and write task assessed acquisition of domain knowledge. Word learning was poorer than has previously been reported in the literature, and subject to influences of word type (domain-specificity) and word class. The results indicate that the acquisition of scientific terms is a complex process moderated by lexical, semantic and pragmatic factors"

59,Patterns of naming objects and actions in children with word finding difficulties,"Children who experience difficulties in naming are described as having word finding difficulties (WFDs). In the present study 31 children with WFDs were identified through a wider survey of educational provision for those with language and communication difficulties. The children were included if they were between 6;4-7;10 years, had normal non-verbal intelligence, no major articulation difficulties and had WFDs as diagnosed by the Test of Word Finding Difficulties (TWF, German, 1989). Three control groups were identified who were matched on: chronological age (N = 31), naming age (N = 31) and level of receptive grammar (N = 31). Children’s comprehension of words, accuracy of naming and latency to name were assessed for numerals, letters and pictures of objects and actions. Half the pictures presented were high frequency items and half were low frequency items. The children with WFDs formed a heterogeneous group with respect to other language measures with the primary defining feature being their poor performance in word retrieval and their poor performance on a semantic fluency test. No differences were found between the children with WFDs and their age-matched peers when naming letters and numerals or in the comprehension of objects and actions. In contrast, the accuracy and latency of naming were significantly worse than that of age matched peers. Accuracy of naming was equivalent to that of the language matched peers and error patterns also were similar. However, the children with WFDs were the slowest to provide responses and for naming high frequency objects this difference approached significance in comparison to language matched peers (p = .052). The findings point to the importance of using appropriate control groups, and are discussed in relation to the idea that WFDs are caused by impoverished semantic representations"
60,Beyond naming patterns in children with WFDs: definitions for nouns and verbs,"Children who experience difficulties in naming are described as having word finding difficulties (WFDs). In the present study 31 children with WFDs were identified through a wider survey of educational provision for those with language and communication difficulties. The children were included if they were between 6;4-7;10 years, had normal non-verbal intelligence, no major articulation difficulties and had WFDs as diagnosed by standard scores below 75 on Test of Word Finding Difficulties (TWF, German, 1989). Three control groups were identified who were matched on: chronological age (N = 31), naming age (N = 31) and level of receptive grammar (N = 31). Children?s accuracy of naming and latency to name were assessed for pictures of objects and actions. Children were asked to define the object and action terms at a later point. Children with WFDs were significantly less accurate in naming than their age matched peers but equivalent to that of the language matched peers. The group of children with WFDs were the slowest to accurately name all sets of items. All groups of children were less accurate in the provision of definitions for action terms than object terms. Overall the children with WFDs provided fewer accurate definitions than their chronological age matched peers. The nature of the children?s definitions indicated that they also differed from their language-matched peers. Particular difficulties were noted in the provision of semantic categorisation information. A range of standardised language assessments did not account for these difficulties. The findings are discussed in relation to the idea that WFDs are caused by impoverished semantic representations"
61,Whose job is it?: parents' concerns about the needs of their children with language problems,"This study examined the perspectives of parents of children with specific speech and language difficulties (SSLD) in the UK and described the issues they raised when considering provision to meet their children's needs. The study utilised a mixed methods approach. Data from interviews were analyzed using a computer-based qualitative interview analysis method (ATLAS/ti), with reference to evidence from a parent-completed rating scale and assessments of the children’s language and educational development. The issues generated by the analyses were considered in relation to whether the child attended mainstream or special school. Results are discussed in the context of current educational policies for inclusive education and parental participation in meeting children’s educational and social needs"

European Journal of Special Needs Education, 23 (1). pp. 1-16. European Journal of Special Needs Education is available online at: http://www.informaworld.com/10.1080/0885625070179120"
63,The relation between naming and literacy in children with word-finding difficulties,"Difficulties with picture naming tasks are associated with literacy problems. Children with dyslexia, when given naming tasks, are slower to produce words and have a higher proportion of errors (Wolf and Bowers, 1999). However, little is known about the relation between literacy and naming in other populations. This study investigates this relation in 20 children (aged 6:6 – 7:11) with word-finding difficulties (WFDs). The children in our sample performed very poorly on assessments of naming, but unlike children with dyslexia, were found to have decoding and spelling abilities within the normal range. In addition, their abilities on phonological awareness tasks were at a similar level to their decoding abilities. In contrast, performance on reading comprehension and language comprehension was significantly worse than for decoding, spelling and rhyme awareness. The implications of our findings for models concerned with understanding the relation between naming speed and literacy abilities are discussed"
64,"Vocabulary is important for some, but not all reading skills","Although there is evidence for a close link between the development of oral vocabulary and reading comprehension, less clear is whether oral vocabulary skills relate to the development of word-level reading skills. This study investigated vocabulary and literacy in 81 children of 8-10 years. In regression analyses, vocabulary accounted for unique variance in exception word reading and reading comprehension, but not text reading accuracy, decoding and regular word reading. Consistent with these data, children with poor reading comprehension exhibited oral vocabulary weaknesses and read fewer exception words correctly. These findings demonstrate that oral vocabulary is associated with some, but not all reading skills. Results are discussed in terms of current models of reading development"
65,Changes in grouping practices over primary and secondary school,"The research detailed in this paper provides a systematic description and analysis of grouping practices in primary and secondary schools in England. Practices are compared to main findings in developmental and educational literature with regard to effective contexts for learning and recent ideas about pedagogy. The research is based on an analysis of 4924 groupings from 672 Reception, Year 2 and Year 5 classes in 331 primary schools and 248 Year 7 and Year 10 classes in 47 secondary schools. The data came from ‘classroom mapping questionnaires’ that were completed by teachers at a particular point in the school day. Completed questionnaires provided information about the nature and use of groupings within their classrooms and focused on the number and size of groupings, type of working interaction between pupils, the presence of adults, grouping composition and the type of task that groupings were engaged with. Results showed that there were changes in grouping practices with pupil age. As pupils got older they were increasingly likely to experience whole class ability based sets (tracking) for core curriculum subjects and more formal row/ pair seating arrangements. Grouping size for learning decreased as pupils got older. Primary school age children were most likely to work on individual work either alone or with the support of an adult. Extra adult support in classes reduced as pupils got older. Secondary school age pupils were more likely to engage in peer interaction than primary age children. Grouping by ability was common at all age levels. As children got older, classroom tasks were more likely to involve the application of existing knowledge and less likely involve practising skills. At the secondary school level, there were indications that teachers co-ordinated grouping size, working interaction type and learning task. These findings indicate that beyond early primary age the main adjustments to pupil grouping with pupil age are in response to the reduced amount of additional adult support. Changing grouping practices are aimed at maintaining control and on-task attention and maximising individual and teacher directed learning but also, in secondary classrooms only, offering pupils opportunities for peer interaction"

67,Agent familiarity and emotional context influence the everyday empathic responding of young children with autism,"Whereas research addressing empathy in ASD tends to employ pencil-and-paper and lab-based behavioural methods, the current study is novel in eliciting parent-report data regarding everyday empathy, sampling various emotional situations regularly encountered by children. Parents of typically-developing children and children diagnosed with ASD and DS completed the newly-developed Day-to-Day Child Empathy Questionnaire. Analysis of descriptions of their children’s responses to the various empathy-inducing situations supports the notion of an empathy deficit in ASD, confirming previous laboratory-based findings. However, important moderation effects were also demonstrated, for both control and clinical groups. In particular, parents reported children in all groups to be more likely to respond empathically to a familiar agent. The nature of children’s responses also according to the specific emotional context"
68,Improving the effectiveness of collaborative group work in primary schools: effect on Science attainment,This longitudinal research tests the effectiveness of the SPRinG programme which was developed through a collaboration between researchers and teachers and designed to provide teachers with strategies for enhancing pupil group work in ‘authentic’ classroom settings. An evaluation study involved comparing pupils in SPRinG classrooms and trained in group work skills with those who were not in terms of science attainment. There were 560 and 1027 pupils (8-10 years) in the experimental and control groups respectively. ‘Macro’ attainment data were collected at the start of the year. ‘Micro’ attainment data were collected in the spring and summer before and after science lessons involving either group work (intervention) or the control teachers’ usual approach. SPRinG pupils made greater academic progress than control pupils. Findings are discussed relative to enhancing the quantity and quality of group work in schools and a social pedagogic approach to classroom learning

70,Temperament influences on parenting and child psychopathology: Socio-economic disadvantage as moderator,"Despite calls for research on how the socio-economic environment may be related to temperament we still do not know enough about the relationship between temperament and socio-economic disadvantage (SED). A particularly underresearched question in temperament research is how SED may moderate the temperament-parenting and the temperament-child psychopathology links. The paper argues that, to develop theory, future temperament studies should seek to explore how the timing, specificity or accumulation, level and duration and change of SED may be related not only to temperament but also to links between temperament and parenting and between temperament and child psychopathology"

72,The Effect of Class Size on the Teaching of Pupils Aged 7-11 Years,"There is still little consensus on whether and how teaching is affected by small and large classes, especially in the case of students in the later primary years. This study investigated effects of class size on teaching of pupils aged 7-11 years. We used a multi-method approach, integrating qualitative information from teachers’ end-of-year accounts and data from case studies with quantitative information from systematic observations. Results showed that there was more individual attention in smaller classes, a more active role for pupils and beneficial effects on the quality of teaching. It is suggested that teachers, in both large and small classes, need to develop strategies for more individual attention but to also recognize the benefits of other forms of learning, e.g., group work"
73,Ambitious mothers-successful daughters: Mothers’ early expectations for children’s education and children’s earnings and sense of control in adult life,"Background: Mothers’ expectations for their children’s educational attainment are related to children’s educational and occupational attainment. Studies have yet to establish, however, long term links between maternal expectations and offspring earnings, which are not always related to occupational attainment especially in women, or between maternal expectations and offspring sense of control and self-efficacy, which are pivotal factors in career choice and development. Aims: To explore the role of mothers’ expectations for their children’s educational attainment in children’s earnings attainment and sense of control later in life. Method: Data from sweeps of the 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70) were used. The study sample was those cohort members with complete information on all the variables of interest. The study sample (N=3,285) was more educated and less disadvantaged than the whole sample. If cohort members of this type are more likely to have a mother who has high expectations then our results are biased downwards, which suggests that we underestimate the effect of expectations on our two outcome variables. Results: Mothers’ expectations at age 10 were positively related to daughters’ sense of control at age 30 even after controlling for ethnicity, educational attainment, and concurrent partner, parent, and labor market participation status, as well as the following confounding variables (measured at ages 0-10): general ability and general ability squared, locus of control, emotional and behavioral problems and emotional and behavioral problems squared, socio-economic disadvantage, parental social class, parental family structure, and mother’s education, child-rearing attitudes and mental health. Mothers’ expectations had no effect in sons’ adult outcomes. Conclusions: Given that women are particularly at risk for poor psychological and economic outcomes in adulthood, and that this study likely underestimated the effect of expectations on these two outcomes, this is an important conclusion"
74,An analytical framework for policy engagement: the contested case of 14-19 reform in England,"This article attempts to construct an analytical framework to reflect upon the deeply contested area of 14-19 education and training policy in England following the publication of the Government’s White Paper ‘14-19 Education and Skills’. We argue that the evolution of 14-19 policy over the last fifteen years, culminating in the publication of the Tomlinson Final Report on 14-19 reform and then its rejection by the Government, might be better understood by looking at this area through the application of four related conceptual tools - political eras, the education state, the policy process and the operation of political space. These concepts or tools are used here both to narrate historical and recent 14-19 developments, to critique current policy-making in this area, and to identify opportunities and challenges facing researchers seeking to engage with the policy process. We suggest that this analytical framework might not only be applied to reform in the 14-19 phase but also to education policy more widely"
75,Critical Race Theory and Education: racism and anti-racism in educational theory and praxis,"What is Critical Race Theory (CRT) and what does it offer educational researchers and practitioners outside the US? This paper addresses these questions by examining the recent history of antiracist research and policy in the UK. In particular, the paper argues that conventional forms of antiracism have proven unable to keep pace with the development of increasingly racist and exclusionary education polices that operate beneath a veneer of professed tolerance and diversity. In particular, contemporary antiracism lacks clear statements of principle and theory that risk reinventing the wheel with each new study; it is increasingly reduced to a meaningless slogan; and it risks appropriation within a reformist “can do” perspective dominated by the de-politicized and managerialist language of school effectiveness and improvement. In contrast, CRT offers a genuinely radical and coherent set of approaches that could revitalize critical research in education across a range of inquiries, not only in self-consciously ""multicultural"" studies. The paper reviews the developing terrain of CRT in education, identifying its key defining elements and the conceptual tools that characterise the work. CRT in education is a fast changing and incomplete project but it can no longer be ignored by the academy beyond North America"
76,Mental Health of Parents and Life Satisfaction of Children: A Within-Family Analysis of Intergenerational Transmission of Well-Being,"This paper addresses the extent to which there is an intergenerational transmission of mental health and subjective well-being within families. Specifically it asks whether parents’ own mental distress influences their child’s life satisfaction, and vice versa. Whilst the evidence on daily contagion of stress and strain between members of the same family is substantial, the evidence on the transmission between parental distress and children’s well-being over a longer period of time is sparse. We tested this idea by examining the within-family transmission of mental distress from parent to child’s life satisfaction, and vice versa, using rich longitudinal data on 1,175 British youths. Results show that parental distress at year t-1 is an important determinant of child’s life satisfaction in the current year. This is true for boys and girls, although boys do not appear to be affected by maternal distress levels. The results also indicated that the child’s own life satisfaction is related with their father’s distress levels in the following year, regardless of the gender of the child. Finally, we examined whether the underlying transmission correlation is due to shared social environment, empathic reactions, or transmission via parent-child interaction"
77,Economics of education research: a review and future prospects,"In this paper we offer an appraisal of the economics of education research area, charting its history as a field and discussing the ways in which economists have contributed both to education research and to education policy-making. In particular, we highlight the theoretical and methodological contributions that economists have made to the field of education during the last 50 years. Despite the success of the economics of education as a field of inquiry, we argue that some of the contributions made by economists could be limited if the economics of education is seen as quite distinct from the other disciplines working in the field of education. In these areas of common interest, economists need to work side by side with the other major disciplines in the field of education if their contribution to the field is to be maximised, particularly in terms of applying improved methodology. We conclude that the study of education acquisition and its economic and social impact in the economics of education research area is very likely to remain a fertile research ground. Acknowledgement"

80,Visuo-spatial cognition in Williams syndrome: Reviewing and accounting for the strengths and weaknesses in performance,"Individuals with Williams syndrome typically show relatively poor visuo-spatial abilities in comparison to stronger verbal skills. However, individuals' level of performance is not consistent across all visuo-spatial tasks. The studies assessing visuo-spatial functioning in Williams syndrome are critically reviewed, in order to provide a clear pattern of the relative difficulty of these tasks. This prompts a possible explanation of the variability in performance seen which focuses on the processing demands of some of these tasks. Individuals with Williams syndrome show an atypical processing style on tests of construction, which does not affect tests of perception"
81,Exploring block construction and mental imagery: Evidence of atypical orientation discrimination in Williams syndrome,"The visuo-spatial perceptual abilities of individuals with Williams syndrome (WS) were investigated in two experiments. Experiment 1 measured the ability of participants to discriminate between oblique and between nonoblique orientations. Individuals with WS showed a smaller effect of obliqueness in response time, when compared to controls matched for non-verbal mental age. Experiment 2 investigated the possibility that this deviant pattern of orientation discrimination accounts for the poor ability to perform mental rotation in WS (Farran et al., 2001). A size transformation task was employed, which shares the image transformation requirements of mental rotation, but not the orientation discrimination demands. Individuals with WS performed at the same level as controls. The results suggest a deviance at the perceptual level in WS, in processing orientation, which fractionates from the ability to mentally transform images"
82,"Divided attention, selective attention and drawing: Processing preferences in Williams syndrome are dependent on the task administered","The visuo-spatial abilities of individuals with Williams syndrome (WS) have consistently been shown to be generally weak. These poor visuo-spatial abilities have been ascribed to a local processing bias by some [30] and conversely, to a global processing bias by others [24]. In this study, two identification versions and one drawing version of the Navon hierarchical processing task, a non-verbal task, were employed to investigate this apparent contradiction. The two identification tasks were administered to 21 individuals with WS, 21 typically developing individuals, matched by non-verbal ability, and 21 adult participants matched to the WS group by mean chronological age. The third, drawing task was administered to the WS group and the TD controls only. It was hypothesised that the WS group would show differential processing biases depending on the type of processing the task was measuring. Results from two identification versions of the Navon task measuring divided and selective attention showed that the WS group experienced equal interference from global to local as from local to global levels, and did not show an advantage of one level over another. This pattern of performance was broadly comparable to that of the control groups. The third task, a drawing version of the Navon task, revealed that individuals with WS were significantly better at drawing the local form in comparison to the global figure, whereas the typically developing control group did not show a bias towards either level. In summary, this study demonstrates that individuals with WS do not have a local or a global processing bias when asked to identify stimuli, but do show a local bias in their drawing abilities. This contrast may explain the apparently contrasting findings from previous studies"
83,Mental rotation in Williams syndrome: an impaired imagery ability,"Typically developing young children and individuals with intellectual disabilities often perform poorly on mental rotation tasks when the stimulus they are rotating lacks a salient component. However, performance can be improved when salience is increased. The present study investigated the effect of salience on mental rotation performance by individuals with Williams syndrome. Individuals with Williams syndrome and matched controls were presented with two versions of a mental rotation task: a no salient component condition and a salient component condition. The results showed that component salience did not benefit individuals with Williams syndrome in the same manner as it did controls"
84,How do individuals with Williams syndrome learn a route in a real-world environment?,"Individuals with Williams syndrome (WS) show a specific deficit in visuo-spatial abilities. This finding, however, is mainly based on performance on small-scale laboratory-based tasks. This study investigated large-scale route learning in individuals with WS and two matched control groups (moderate learning difficulty group [MLD], typically developing group [TD]). In a non-labelling and a labelling (verbal information provided along the route) condition, participants were guided along one of two unfamiliar 1 km routes with 20 junctions, and then retraced the route themselves (two trials). The WS participants performed less well than the other groups, but given verbal information and repeated experience they learnt nearly all of the turns along the route. The extent of improvement in route knowledge (correct turns) in WS was comparable to that of the control groups. Relational knowledge (correctly identifying spatial relationships between landmarks), compared to the TD group, remained poor for both the WS and MLD groups. Assessment of the relationship between performance on the large-scale route learning task to that on three small-scale tasks (maze learning, perspective taking, map use) showed no relationship for the TD controls, and only a few non-specific associations in the MLD and WS groups"
85,Children’s Well-Being in Primary School: Pupil and School Effects [Wider Benefits of Learning Research Report No. 25],"This study investigates pupil and school effects on children’s well-being between the ages of 8 and 10. We found that most children experience positive well-being in primary school. However, one in five children suffers from either declining or consistently low well-being during these years. This subset is most likely to be male, low achieving, and from poorer backgrounds. Our research also shows that it is children’s individual experiences, such as interactions with teachers, bullying or friendships, and their beliefs about themselves and their environment, which mainly affect their well-being, rather than the type of school they attend. Although we find that school-level factors have relatively little effect, on average, there are small, but significant, differences between schools which are explained by factors such as school disadvantage and school ethos"
86,Nurturing parenting capability: the early years [Wider Benefits of Learning Research Report No. 30],"This report examines parenting from babyhood to early childhood. We first consider what previous studies have revealed about the nature of good parenting and the determinants of parenting in the early years. Using data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children we then set out to establish whether the individual characteristics of mothers and children, and factors such as mothers’ social networks and marital relations, predict certain types of parenting behaviours. We do this by examining how 1,136 mothers interacted with their child when asked to share a picture book with them. This observation exercise, which measured parental warmth and teaching behaviours, took place when the child was aged one, then again at age five. Lastly, we address the implications of our findings for policy and practice"
87,Determinants of aspirations [Wider Benefits of Learning Research Report No. 27],"Aspirations vary for different sections of the population both in terms of parents’ educational and occupational goals for their children and the ambitions of the young people themselves. In this report, we review the current research literature across a range of disciplines to set out these differences and consider how educational and career aspirations are formed and developed in response to different environments and circumstances. We also examine the extent to which aspirations are related to eventual outcomes and discuss the implications for current policies and practices. Research indicates that aspirations begin to be shaped early in a child’s life, but are modified by experience and the environment. Aspirations tend to decline as children mature, in response to their growing understanding of the world and what is possible, and to constraints imposed by previous choices and achievements. This decline is particularly marked for those facing multiple barriers. Girls, young people from minority ethnic groups and those from higher socio-economic backgrounds tend to hold higher aspirations than their counterparts. Parents from these groups also tend to have higher aspirations for their children. Conversely, socially disadvantaged groups such as teenage parents tend to have low aspirations for themselves and for their children. In general, those who have, or whose parents have, high aspirations have better outcomes, even when taking into account individual and family factors, but this is not a universal effect. For some groups, high aspirations do not lead to higher achievement. In particular, there is a gap between educational aspirations and achievement for young people from some minority ethnic groups and a gap between girls’ occupational aspirations and career attainment. Practical and attitudinal barriers to the formation of high aspirations are evident. Financial constraints may limit some groups’ access to opportunities and enabling resources such as computers and private tuition. Equally, some individuals are limited by earlier achievement and choices such as leaving school or becoming a parent at a young age. But attitudes are also important. Young people who believe they have the ability to achieve and who attribute their success to hard work, rather than luck or fate, tend to have higher aspirations than their peers. The early years of a child’s life are a key time in the formation and development of aspirations. During this time, parents may need support to overcome both attitudinal and practical barriers to high aspirations. Schools can play a part in maintaining and realising ambitions, and the support they provide becomes more important when family resources are limited. Later, young people need easy access to advice and guidance and the involvement of professionals or volunteers – for example in a mentoring role – when necessary. Involvement in positive activities may also provide important socialising experiences that encourage high aspirations"
88,"Perceptual Grouping and Distance Estimates in Typical and Atypical Development: Comparing Performance across Perception, Drawing and Construction Tasks","Perceptual grouping is a pre-attentive process which serves to group local elements into global wholes, based on shared properties. One effect of perceptual grouping is to distort the ability to estimate the distance between two elements. In this study, biases in distance estimates, caused by four types of perceptual grouping, were measured across three tasks, a perception, a drawing and a construction task in both typical development (TD; Experiment 1) and in individuals with Williams syndrome (WS; Experiment 2). In Experiment 1, perceptual grouping distorted distance estimates across all three tasks. Interestingly, the effect of grouping by luminance was in the opposite direction to the effects of the remaining grouping types. We relate this to differences in the ability to inhibit perceptual grouping effects on distance estimates. Additive distorting influences were also observed in the drawing and the construction task, which are explained in terms of the points of reference employed in each task. Experiment 2 demonstrated that the above distortion effects are also observed in WS. Given the known deficit in the ability to use perceptual grouping in WS, this suggests a dissociation between the pre-attentive influence of and the attentive deployment of perceptual grouping in WS. The typical distortion in relation to drawing and construction points towards the presence of some typical location coding strategies in WS. The performance of the WS group differed from the TD participants on two counts. First, the pattern of overall distance estimates (averaged across interior and exterior distances) across the four perceptual grouping types, differed between groups. Second, the distorting influence of perceptual grouping was strongest for grouping by shape similarity in WS, which contrasts to a strength in grouping by proximity observed in the TD participants"

It examines historical and current theories of motivation and sets out a model describing the way that the characteristics of the individual including, personality, self-concept and personal goals interact with the environment to influence motivation and subsequent behaviour. The environment may include culture and sub-cultures, society, time, place, institutions, family and peers and the rewards and punishments that these offer. The article then explores research relating to motivation to actively participate in music. This supports the notion that musical motivation is determined by complex interactions between the individual and the environment within which they find themselves. The article concludes with a consideration of directions for future research"

Research (in a number of second languages) has looked at the type of interactions and the type of language that arise from classroom discussions about literature, as well as at the views of teachers and learners. Importantly, the reactions that learners have to incorporating literature in their language lessons are linked to the type of approach and type of task that are used in the classroom. The paper surveys the existing research, as well as evidence from practitioners about approaches that are used and the range of works and authors that are taught"

100,Negative evidence and negative feedback: immediate effects on the grammaticality of child speech,"Until recently, a long-standing assumption in the field of child language acquisition research was that parents do not correct the grammatical errors of their children. While consensus now exists that potentially corrective responses are often supplied, controversy persists as to whether the child can identify and exploit such information in practice. To address these issues, this study adopts the contrast theory of negative input as a framework for analysis (Saxton 1995). In this theory, two distinct kinds of corrective input are identified, termed negative evidence and negative feedback, respectively. The corrective potential of each category was investigated by examining the immediate effects of each on the grammaticality of child speech. A longitudinal corpus of naturalistic data (49 hours) from a single child were analysed with respect to 11 grammatical categories. The effects of negative input were compared with two non-corrective sources of input, namely positive input and adult move-ons. It was found that grammatical forms were more frequent in child speech following negative evidence and negative feedback than either of the two non-corrective sources of input. In light of these, and related, findings, it is argued that corrective input may well prove important in explanations for how the child eventually retreats from error to attain a mature system of grammar"

The authors note claims made for the potential of ACM conferences to promote higher order critical inquiry and the social construction of knowledge and argue that there is a general lack of evidence regarding the actual achievement of these aims in such conferences. We present and discuss the relevant research literature currently available on the effects of social presence, the tutor’s teaching and moderating strategies, and task type. The paper concludes with recommendations for future research in each of these areas"
108,Auditory Discrimination and Auditory Sensory Behaviours in Autism Spectrum Disorders,"It has been hypothesised that auditory processing may be enhanced in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). We tested auditory discrimination ability in 72 adolescents with ASD (39 childhood autism; 33 other ASD) and 57 IQ and age-matched controls, assessing their capacity for successful discrimination of the frequency, intensity and duration differences in pairs of sounds.At the group level, auditory discrimination ability did not differ between the adolescents with and without ASD. However, we found a subgroup of 20% of individuals in the ASD group who showed ‘exceptional’ frequency discrimination skills (defined as 1.65 SDs above the control mean) and who were characterised by average intellectual ability and delayed language onset. Auditory sensory behaviours (i.e. behaviours in response to auditory sensory input) are common in ASD and we hypothesised that these would relate to auditory discrimination ability. For the ASD group, poor performers on the intensity discrimination task reported more auditory sensory behaviours associated with coping with loudness levels. Conversely, those who performed well on the duration discrimination task reported more auditory sensory behaviours across the full range measured. Frequency discrimination ability did not associate with auditory sensory behaviours. We therefore conclude that (i) enhanced frequency discrimination is present in around 1 in 5 individuals with ASD and may represent a specific phenotype; and (ii) individual differences in auditory discrimination ability in ASD may influence the expression of auditory sensory behaviours by modulating the degree to which sounds are detected or missed in the environment"

110,"Gender, Narratives and Intersectionality: can Personal Experience Approaches to Research Contribute to “Undoing Gender”?","This paper examines the use of narrative methodologies as one approach to exploring issues of gender, education and social justice and particularly insights into ‘undoing gender’. Drawing on feminist beliefs in the significance of experiential evidence, the paper examines the possibilities of exploring gender and its multiple intersections in a range of global and policy contexts through the use of personal experience approaches. The ‘storying’ of lived experience is examined as a means of challenging dominant discourses which can construct and other individuals and groups in relation to many aspects of gender and education. Drawing on intersectionality, as an ambiguous, complex and developing feminist theory, the paper considers ways in which narrative can illuminate often hidden complexities while seeking to avoid simplistic generalisations and essentialisms. The difficulties of using narrative in relation to these aims are explored being mindful of the warnings of feminist writers such as Michele Fine and bel hooks. The paper briefly considers narrative as both methodology and phenomenon, and finally, drawing on critical discourse analysis, discusses the potential of intersectionality and narrative in relation to undoing gender"

114,Needing to be 'in the know': strategies of subordination used by 10-11 year-old schoolboys,"It is important for educators to understand the tactics used in subordination between young people if they are going to take effective measures to counter them in their pedagogical practice. This paper explores strategies used by school boys aged 10-11 to subordinate and position boys at the bottom of the pupil hierarchy. The findings are based on data gathered from a year long empirical study (between 1998 and 1999) set in three UK junior schools which were differentiated by the social characteristics of their intake. The research emphasises the role of the body in the construction of masculinity. The hegemonic, or most idealised, form of masculinity at each school was constructed around activity and, in particular, various forms of embodied physicality/athleticism (exemplified through skill, strength, fitness and speed), and boys who did not wish to, or who were unable to, use these resources generally found themselves marginalised and/or subordinated. Many of the subordinated forms were symbolically assimilated to femininity, and the paper proposes that the main strategies of subordination can be summarised under the generic heading of ‘difference’. The final section discusses the pervasive use of homophobia, and concludes that it should be conceptualised in terms of gender as well as sex"
115,The resources and strategies that 10-11 year-old boy use to construct masculinities in the school setting,"The data in this paper comes from an ethnographic exploration into the construction of masculinities in three junior schools in the UK between 1998 and 1999. I argue that the construction and performance of masculinity is inextricably linked to the acquisition of status within the school peer group, and I delineate the specific series of resources and strategies that the boys draw on and use in each setting to achieve this. The different meanings and practices at each school, and the different array of resources available, means that there are a different set of options and/or opportunities within each school setting to do boy, and I classify these as being either open (possible), restricted (more difficult), or closed (almost impossible). The principal and most esteemed resource used by the boys was physicality and athleticism, and I highlight the link between masculinity and the body"

117,Mapping a beautiful voice : theoretical considerations,The prime purpose of this paper is to draw on a range of diverse literatures to clarify those elements thatare perceived to constitute a ‘beautiful’ sung performance. The text rehearses key findings from existingliteratures in order to determine the extent to which particular elements might appear the most salientfor an individual listener and also ‘quantifiable’ (in the sense of being open to empirical study). Thepaper concludes with a theoretical framework for the elements that are likely to construct and shape ourresponses to particular sung performances
118,Learning through work experience,"How students learn and develop through work experience is here analysed. We draw upon contemporary learning theory, recent developments in the adult education and curriculum theory in developing a critique of current thinking and explore how far this provides the basis for a new pedagogic model for supporting learning through work experience. We discuss the concept of 'context' and the learning which occurs within and between the different contexts of education and work and argue that most models of work experience have either ignored the influence of context upon learning or have approached this issue mechanistically. New curriculum frameworks are needed to and to allow work in all of its forms to be used as a basis for the development of knowledge, skills and identity. We present a typology of work experience which identifies models of work experience, including a model which embodies the concept of 'connectivity'. We suggest that this may provide the basis for a productive and useful relationship between formal and informal learning"
119,The National Singing Programme for primary schools in England: an initial baseline study,"The ‘Sing Up’ National Singing Programme for Primary schools in England was launched in November 2007 under the UK Government’s ‘Music Manifesto’. ‘Sing Up’ is a four-year programme whose overall aim is to raise the status of singing and increase opportunities for children throughout the country to enjoy singing as part of their everyday lives, in and out of school. As part of the Programme’s research evaluation, a key focus has been to build an initial picture of singing in Primary schools across England. This information could then be used as a ‘baseline’ by which the programme’s subsequent impact could be judged, including ‘before’ and ‘after’ measures of schools that receive particular ‘Sing Up’ input. This paper reports an overview of key outcomes of first five months of baseline profiling (October, 2007 to February 2008), embracing analyses of the singing behaviours of 3,472 children in 76 Primary schools. These findings are complimented by additional analyses of children’s views on singing in and out of school; and the self-efficacy of their class teachers’ (n=90), both as singers and as teachers of singing"

As such, the focus on identifying a prodrome over the past 20 years has been on pre-clinical signs or indicators that will be present very early in life, certainly in infancy. A number of novel lines of investigation have been used to this end, including retrospective coding of home videos, prospective population screening and ‘high risk’ sibling studies; as well as the investigation of pre- and peri-natal, brain developmental and other biological factors. Whilst no single prodromal sign is expected to be present in all cases, a picture is emerging of indicative prodromal signs in infancy and initial studies are being undertaken to attempt to ameliorate the early presentation and even ‘prevent’ emergence of the full syndrome"
129,Trade and income inequality in developing countries,"We use a dynamic specification to estimate the impact of trade on within-country income inequality in a sample of 65 developing countries (DCs) over the 1980-1999 period. Our results suggest that trade with high income countries worsen income distribution in DCs, both through imports and exports. These findings provide support to the hypothesis that technological differentials and the skill biased nature of new technologies may be important factors in shaping the distributive effects of trade. Moreover, we observe that the previous results only hold for middle income countries (MICs); we interpret this evidence by considering the greater potential for technological upgrading in MICs"

131,"Education for Democratic Citizenship: a review of research, policy and practice 1995-2005","This paper provides a synthesis of the scholarly literature on education for democratic citizenship (EDC) in the school sector in England since 1995. Following the publication of the Crick Report (QCA, 1998), citizenship education was introduced to secondary schools in 2002 as a statutory subject. Primary schools are also required to show, through inspection, how they are preparing learners for citizenship. The implementation of citizenship as a national curriculum subject in England is taking place during a period of constitutional reform and was the most significant innovation of curriculum 2000. Recent parallel initiatives in EDC are taking place elsewhere in the UK, in Europe and internationally. In both established democracies and newlyestablished democratic states, such as those of Eastern and Central Europe and Latin America, there is a recognition that democracy is essentially fragile and that it depends on the active engagement of citizens, not just in voting, but in developing and participating in sustainable and cohesive communities. The paper examines the role of EDC in responding to these political challenges, setting national policy developments in both European and international contexts and exploring the growing international consensus on human rights as the underpinning principles of EDC. It identifies some key themes within the research, such as diversity and unity; global and cosmopolitan citizenship; children as citizens; democratic schooling; students’ understandings of citizenship and democracy; the complementary roles of schools and communities; European citizenship; and the practicalities of implementing EDC at school level. It identifies some gaps in the research literature and concludes by proposing an on-going agenda for research"

Approximately 400 children were pre-tested, ninety-five were assigned to Reading Recovery, ninety-seven to Phonological Training and the remainder acted as controls. In the short and medium-term both interventions significantly improved aspects of children’s reading, Reading Recovery having a broader and more powerful effect. In the longterm, three and a half years after intervention, there were no significant effects on reading overall, though Reading Recovery had a significant effect for a sub-group of children who were complete non-readers at six years old. Phonological training had a significant effect on spelling. The short and medium-term effects demonstrate that it is possible to substantially reduce children’s reading problems. The long-term effects raise doubts about relying on early intervention alone"

It was hypothesised by Kun (1997) that FGC increases the risk of HIV transmission through a number of different mechanisms. Using the 2003 data from the Kenyan Demographic and Health Survey (KDHS), this study investigates the potential association between FGC and HIV. The 2003 KDHS provides a unique opportunity to link the HIV test results with a large number of demographic, social, economic and behavioural characteristics of women, including women’s FGC status. It is hypothesised that FGC increases the risk of HIV infection if HIV/AIDS is present in the community. A multilevel binary logistic regression technique is used to model the HIV status of women, controlling for selected individual characteristics of women and interaction effects. The results demonstrate evidence of a statistically significant association between FGC and HIV, after controlling for the hierarchical structure of the data, potential confounding factors, and interaction effects. The results show that women who had had FGC and a younger or the same age first union partner have higher odds of being HIV positive than women with a younger or same age first union partner but without FGC; whereas women who had had FGC and an older first union partner have lower odds of being HIV positive than women with an older first union partner but without FGC. The findings suggest the behavioural pathway of association between FGC and HIV as well as an underlying complex interplay of bio-behavioural and social variables being important in disentangling the association between FGC and HIV"

155,The Many Faces of Lifelong Learning: Recent Education Policy Trends in Europe,This article examines the rise of the discourse on lifelong learning across Europe and the variety of national policy trends which its rhetoric occludes. The ubiquitous presence of this meta-discourse in education and training policy-in-theory is seen as a singular event which can be ascribed to the impact of the variety of global forces on the education arena. It serves specific political functions in addition to signalling real changes in education and training systems. The duality of convergent rhetoric and divergent policy- in- practise is seen as a challenge to education policy analysis which requires multi-layered interpretation

157,Education and Social Cohesion: Re-Centering the Debate,"Social Capital theory has tended to treat social cohesion as a mere aggregation of individual and community level characteristics, ignoring the long tradition of theory on social solidarity and social cohesion at the societal level. However, the key indicators of social capital – associational membership and social trust – do not co-vary cross nationally and societies rich in community level social capital are not always cohesive societies. Social capital and societal cohesion are not necessarily the same thing and education may have different effects on each. This article seeks to put the analysis of education and societal cohesion back in the centre of the picture. We do this firstly through a critical review of some of the existing literature on education and social capital which points to the limitations of individual level analysis of what are fundamentally societal issues. Secondly, we outline some alternative models for understanding how education impacts on social cohesion in different societies, drawing on an analysis of some of the aggregated cross-national data on skills, income distribution and various indicators of social cohesion. The argument suggests some causal mechanisms for the social impacts of education that are quite different from those which normally underpin arguments about human and social capital"
158,"Education, Equity and Social Cohesion : A Distributional Model [Wider Benefits of Learning Research Report No. 7]","This report - the first from the Centre’s comparative strand of research - focuses on the effects of education on social cohesion at the societal level. The research involved two elements. The first was a theoretical analysis and critique of models in the existing international and comparative literature on education, social capital and social cohesion. This led to the development of a new hypothetical model relating skills distribution to social cohesion. The second part of the research used cross-national, quantitative techniques to test the model on aggregated data for 15 countries. The analysis suggests that educational distribution may be a very significant influence on societal cohesion in certain contexts. Improving levels of education alone may not foster social solidarity if inequalities of skill and income persist. The findings here have important policy implications. Existing policies focus on developing the individual resources and competences which will help to build social capital and community cohesion. However, these will not necessarily impact on cohesion at the societal level. Creating a more cohesive society is likely to require policies that are also designed to increase equality through narrowing educational outcomes"
159,"The Macro-Social Benefits of Education, Training and Skills in Comparative Perspective [Wider Benefits of Learning Research Report No. 9]","This report, the second from the Centre's strand of comparative research, complements an earlier WBL research report (Education, Equity and Social Cohesion: A Distributional Model) in exploring further themes of societal comparison and the distributional effects of education systems. Despite generally high levels of educational attainment there is huge diversity amongst Western Societies in terms of crime, tolerance, trust and social cohesion. In this report, we take a comparative approach to investigating relationships between education and these outcomes at a societal level. Through an interdisciplinary review of literatures from sociology, history, economics and psychology we examine the role of education systems from a number of countries in influencing trends in, and levels of, these variables. Whilst the importance of country and historical context is stressed throughout we arrive at some general conclusions concerning the role of education systems in the development of various forms of social cohesion. This report will be of interest to policy makers, researchers and practitioners who are interested in the social impact of education systems. In particular, we examine implications for current UK policy targeted at increasing national educational attainment"
160,"The social cognition of medical knowledge, with special reference to childhood epilepsy","This paper arose out of an engagement in medical communication courses at a Gulf university. It deploys a theoretical framework derived from a (critical) sociocognitive approach to discourse analysis in order to investigate three aspects of medical discourse relating to childhood epilepsy: the cognitive processes that are entailed in relating different types of medical knowledge to their communicative context; the types of medical knowledge that are constituted in the three different text types analysed; and the relationship between these different types of medical knowledge and the discursive features of each text type. The paper argues that there is a cognitive dimension to the human experience of understanding and talking about one specialized from of medical knowledge. It recommends that texts be studied in medical communication courses not just in terms of their discrete formal features but also critically, in terms of the knowledge which they produce, transmit and reproduce"
161,The text as a critical object: On theorising exegetic procedure in classroom-based critical discourse analysis,"One of the reasons CDA calls itself critical is because its perspectives of discourse and society are largely derived from critical social theory. Transferring these perspectives to educational contexts requires that teachers develop workable pedagogic frameworks and procedures which apply CDA principles and practices to the reading and discussion of texts in the classroom. If these are to be considered ‘critical,’ it seems useful that these are also derived from critical social theory. This type of critical theorisation seems to be underdeveloped in a CDA which relies principally on systemic functional linguistics for its procedural attitude to the text. This paper suggests a possible development of this space in which exegetic procedure and discussion are theorised from critical perspectives in the thought of Adorno, Derrida and Habermas, and according to systemic perspectives in the work of Foucault. The paper also presents a framework of analysis for use by teachers and students which is based on these perspectives"
162,Cultural relativism and the discourse of intercultural communication: aporias of praxis in the intercultural public sphere,"The premise of much intercultural communication pedagogy and research is to educate people from different cultures towards open and transformative positions of mutual understanding and respect. This discourse in the instance of its articulation realises and sustains Intercultural Communication epistemologically – as an academic field of social enquiry, and judgementally – as one which locates itself on a moral terrain. By adopting an ethical stance towards difference, the discourse of intercultural communication finds itself caught in a series of aporias, or performative contradictions, where interculturalists are projected simultaneously into positions of cultural relativism on the one hand and ideological totalism on the other. Such aporias arise because the theoretical premises upon which the discourse relies are problematic. We trace these thematics to a politics of presence operating within the discourse of intercultural communication and links this to questions of judgement and truth in the intercultural public sphere. We propose that the politics of presence be set aside in favour of an intercultural praxis which is oriented to responsibility rather than to truth"
163,Imagining the World: The Significance of Religious Worldviews for Science Education,"This paper begins by examining whether ‘science’ and ‘religion’ can better be seen as distinct or related worldviews, focusing particularly on scientific and religious understandings of biodiversity. I then explore how people can see the natural world, depending on their worldview, by looking at two contrasting treatments of penguin behaviour, namely that provided in the film March of the Penguins and in the children’s book And Tango Makes Three. I end by drawing some initial conclusions as to what might and what might not be included about religion in school science lessons. Science educators and teachers need to take account of religious worldviews if some students are better to understand the compass of scientific thinking and some of science’s key conclusions. It is perfectly possible for a science teacher to be respectful of the worldviews that students occupy, even if these are scientifically limited, while clearly and non-apologetically helping them to understand the scientific worldview on a particular issue"
164,Predictors of exception word and nonword reading in dyslexic children: the severity hypothesis,"The classification of dyslexic children into discrete subtypes yields a poor description of the dyslexic population at large. Multiple regression methods were used to examine continuous variation in component reading subskills (nonword and exception word reading) and their underlying cognitive skills within a group of 59 9-15 year-old dyslexic children. Two measures of phonological skills contributed unique variance to nonword reading: phonological processing and verbal short-term memory skills. In contrast, the only unique predictor of exception word reading was reading experience. The results are discussed within a connectionist framework that views the decoding deficit in dyslexia as stemming from poorly specified phonological representations. The extent of the nonword reading deficit is determined by the severity of the underlying phonological impairment. In contrast, exception word reading is influenced more by print exposure"

We compare the effect of conceptions and births on the odds that a cohabiting partnership is dissolved or that it is converted to marriage for women born in 1958 and 1970. The analysis uses a multilevel competing risks model to allow for multiple partnerships and conceptions, and to distinguish between two outcomes of cohabiting unions (separation and marriage). We also use a multiprocess model, in which the outcomes of cohabitation are modelled simultaneously with fertility, to allow for the potential joint determination of partnership and childbearing decisions. The analysis is based on partnership and birth histories between the ages of 16 and 29, and social background, in the National Child Development Study and the 1970 British Birth Cohort Study"

In terms of the overall level of qualifications achieved, we find that single-sex schooling is positive for girls at age 16, but neutral for boys, while at later ages, single-sex schooling is neutral for both sexes. However, we find that single-sex schooling is linked to the attainment of qualifications in gender-atypical subject areas for both sexes, not just during the school years, but also later in life"

172,"The influence of context on attainment in primary school: Interactions between children, family and school contexts [Wider Benefits of Learning Research Report No. 28]","Growing awareness of the importance of parents and the home environment in shaping children’s achievement, coupled with the recognition of the school as a site for engagement in broader aspects of social and personal development, has raised interest in the interactions between these different influences as a way of addressing issues of educational attainment and inequality. This study explores the nature of these links and considers the relative contribution of different aspects of four different ‘contexts’ or likely spheres of influence on pupil achievement in England at Key Stage 2 (age 10/11), as well as their associations with one another. The results highlight that the quality of each of the different aspects of their lives is important for children’s attainment in primary school: pupils with better contexts – i.e. better individual, school and family background and experience – have higher scores in Key Stage 2 assessments in English, maths and science. However, these contexts do not act in isolation, but are closely related to one another, and their influence on children’s attainment is affected by these interrelationships. Furthermore, these results indicate that the interaction effects are greater for those with poor quality contexts. This suggests not only that there is scope to narrow the gaps in educational opportunity, but also that, where influence is possible, the greatest likely returns are for those whose background and experience are poor"
173,Development in the early years : Its importance for school performance and adult outcomes [Wider Benefits of Learning Research Report No. 20],"Early development of children’s intellectual, social and physical abilities has the potential to affect their long term achievement, beyond the initial introduction to the classroom, through their school lives and into adulthood. A greater understanding of the processes at work in these early years and their role in later success is therefore important to ensure that resources are appropriately targeted. Past research has shown that early cognitive attainment is strongly related to later academic success. But we are also interested in the benefit that children gain from arriving at school with particular personal characteristics and the relationship which these may have to cognitive development. We also seek to explore the role of development (as opposed to innate capability) in the pre-school years. Data from the 1970 British Cohort Study is used to examine the importance of early measures of children’s cognitive ability and behavioural development for their subsequent school and labour market achievement. Our results suggest that, of the various measures used in this study, the most powerful predictor of later academic and labour market success is the ability of children to copy basic designs. However, we do not ignore the influence of behavioural factors and highlight the particular importance of skills related to attention with respect to these outcomes. The results clearly show that early development of both cognitive and behavioural skills have a role in subsequent achievement. In this respect, we believe that the findings in this report add to the debate on the appropriate balance between cognitive and non-cognitive skills at different ages and for different groups of children. In particular, failure to place sufficient emphasis on cognitive development may run counter to the interests of children from low SES groups. We believe that pedagogy should continue to address ways in which cognitive and non-cognitive abilities can support one another and how the interactions between these different groups of skills can best be harnessed for different groups of children"

190,A cognitive approach to understanding the behaviour of museum visitors,"Previous studies of the behaviour of museum visitors and the\ud
theories of exhibit effectiveness that have stemmed from them are reviewed and criticised on a number of grounds. The principle criticism is directed at the prevailing notion of the Museum Visitor as a passive being whose actions are determined by internal or external forces over which he or she has no control.\ud
A new theory of exhibit effectiveness is presented that accepts the visitor as an active agent who acts in accordance with his or her perceptions of individual displays. Real-world exhibits are conceptualised in terms of their proximity to a putative 'ideal' exhibit as measured by their and the ideal's perceived characteristics; the more characteristics a real-world exhibit shares with the ideal, the more visitors it will attract. The theory seeks to provide an explanation as to why certain exhibits attract visitors and why others fail to do so.\ud
A novel system of recording the behaviour of visitors to the\ud
Hall of Human Biology at the Natural History Museum using closed circuit television and a real-time event recorder is described; and a study of inter-observer reliability is reported. A large prospective study of visitors to the Hall of Human Biology is reported in which the 'attracting power' of exhibits are defined and measured. In addition new statistics pertinent to the behaviour of individual visitors are defined and related to individuals' interest in the topics covered in the exhibition.\ud
Further studies report how the characteristics of exhibits as perceived by visitors were elicited; and how a sample of realworld exhibits and the ideal were evaluated by visitors in terms of these characteristics to provide the necessary data for testing the theory.\ud
The implications of the theory for designers of exhibitions are discussed and further avenues for research are suggested"

200,"The financing of secondary education in Mezam Division, North West Province Cameroon : an uneasy partnership between family and state","The government of Cameroon like that of many Sub-S aharan African countries is\ud
faced with dwindling revenues and cannot provide the required fmances for the education\ud
sector. Since many other developing countries are facing similar fmancial constraints,\ud
policy options have been proposed for the recovery of costs as a way of revitalizing and\ud
improving the quality of education in these countries. The introduction of user charges is\ud
one of the more prominent options that applies to all levels of education. In light of the\ud
educational financing situation in Cameroon, this study sets out to assess the possibility\ud
of implementing this option. It therefore seeks to analyze how secondary schools are\ud
fmanced and to measure private direct costs of secondary education so as to determine\ud
parental willingness to spend on schooling.\ud
A household and a school survey were conducted in Mezam Division of the North\ud
West Province of Cameroon. 335 households in urban and rural areas were involved in\ud
the household survey, while 16 principals and 750 students, selected from 16 secondary\ud
schools, took part in the school survey. Results from these surveys indicate that in\ud
government secondary schools, although tuition is provided free, parents are obliged to\ud
meet the costs of books and uniforms. Moreover, because government funding is\ud
inadequate, by default, parents are obliged to contribute further towards the provision of\ud
additional facilities in these schools through the Parent-Teacher Association (PTA). Thus\ud
parents incur substantial costs for their children's education, in relation to household\ud
income and Gross National per Capita Income. The study also reveals that in the private\ud
educational sector, fees and other parental contributions, including PTA levies, form an\ud
important source of finance for secondary schools. Parents of government school students\ud
value the education of their children highly, and therefore indicated willingness to pay\ud
more, even though they already incur substantial costs. The findings further indicate that\ud
willingness to pay will be increased if the quality of education is improved. However,\ud
ability to pay is related to family income and number of children, which have important\ud
implications for equity which are discussed in the thesis. Finally the study reveals that the\ud
highly centralized financing policy and practice in government secondary schools does not\ud
take into account the fmancial capacity of communities and private individuals\ud
sufficiently.\ud
The thesis argues that, in order to improve access, quality and efficiency of\ud
educational provision, an appropriate cost-sharing strategy needs to be developed to\ud
finance government secondary schools, with provision of scholarships or other selective\ud
assistance to the most needy. The thesis suggests further that, efforts be made to explore\ud
parental willingness and the inherent self help tradition of the people, by encouraging\ud
local management and fmancing of schools. Hence support from individual users and\ud
contributions from local communities through Parent-Teacher-Associations should be\ud
actively solicited. It also suggests that the decentralization of educational management of\ud
schools will go a long way towards enhancing educational quality and efficiency. This\ud
will require some adjustments to the existing financing structures, and changes in the\ud
regulation and management of the education system. The successful implementation of\ud
these recommendations require immense political will on the part of the policy makers"

203,Problem-based learning : a catalyst for enabling and disabling disjunction prompting transitions in learner stances,"This study demonstrates that while problem-based learning (PBL) may promote many\ud
of the abilities currently high on the agenda in British higher education in the 1990s, the\ud
wider implications of the implementation of PBL are more complex and far reaching.\ud
This multi site study was qualitative and post-positivist in its design and process. The\ud
focus was to: examine the expectations and experiences of staff and students in\ud
different professional and educational environments who are involved in using PBL in\ud
some way. What emerged was a new model for understanding the nature of learner\ud
experience on PBL programmes, charactensed by significant diversity between\ud
espoused aims and values, what happened in practice and in relationships between staff\ud
and students.\ud
Disjunction is a concept seen by many as a starting point for learning. (Jarvis, 1987;\ud
Weil, 1989). Students are often offered through PBL the opportunity to own their\ud
learning experiences and develop independence in inquiry. It is these very\ud
opportunities which seemed to prompt different forms of disjunction. This research\ud
extends earlier work around the concept of disjunction in learning, and the notion of\ud
enabling and disabling forms in relation to three different understandings of ""learner\ud
stance"". These three stances present a multifaceted view of learner experience. The\ud
emergent model suggests ways in which students are prompted to reflect upon and\ud
reconstruct their learner identity. This in turn may result in transitions within their\ud
personal, pedagogical and interactional stances as learners within particular\ud
environments.\ud
The study concludes by suggesting that the notion of learner stances and transitions\ud
which occur in relation to them, offer a framework for broadening current\ud
understandings of learner experience on diverse PBL programmes, whilst arguing that\ud
PBL may prompt new forms of transformation in relation to students' past, present and\ud
future constructions of learning and of themselves as learners"

208,The construction of meanings in and for : a stochastic domain of abstraction.,"This study takes as its focus young children's intuitive knowledge of randomness. Previous work in this field has studied the misconceptions that people, especially adults, hold in making judgements of chance (see, for example, the work of Kahneman & Tversky and Konold).\ud
In contrast, I study how primitive meaningsf or randomnessfo rm a basis for new meanings,a processw hich the misconceptionsa pproachf ails to illuminate. The guiding principle for this study is that the observation of students' evolving thought in a carefully designedc omputer-basedd omain will provide a betteru nderstanding of how the specific features of the domain shape and are shaped by activities within it.\ud
There are, then, two deeply connected strands to this thesis: the study of children's evolving meanings for randomness as expressed in a computer-based microworld, and the articulation of design principles which encapsulate pedagogic meaningsfor that microworld. More specifically, the thesis aims to shed light upon the answers to four crucial questions:\ud
Meanings for the domain:\ud
What do formalisms of stochastic behaviour look like in a domain of abstraction?\ud
What structures in the domain for stochastic abstraction optimise the articulation of intuitions and the construction of new meanings? \ud
Meanings in the domain:\ud
What articulations of informal intuitions of stochastic behaviour do we observe? \ud
How do the structures of the domain support the forging of situated meanings?\ud
The study uses an iterative design methodology, which cycles between the design of computer-based tools and the observ4tion of children, between the ages of 9 and II years, as they use these tools. The thesis identifies initial meanings for the behaviour of various stochastic phenomena and traces how new pieces of knowledge, especially relating to long term random behaviour, emerge through the forging of connections between the internal and external resources.  \u"
209,Literacy in a new town school : a critical ethnography of the reading and writing of secondary school pupils in Milton Keynes.,"This thesis sets out to answer the question: what is literacy in a new town and \ud
how do children in schools come to learn it? My concern is not only with official\ud
literate activities but also subversive ones. To begin with, I tell the story of the thesis\ud
from the point of view of a teacher-researcher. I argue that the starting point\ud
must be the relative histories of literacy of observer and observed. I thus narrate\ud
my own history of literacy. Then, in order to begin to look at the history of the\ud
observed, I recount the history of literacy and education in Milton Keynes and district\ud
from I 800. Within this, I locate literacy in the present culture of Milton\ud
Keynes as a new town. This brings me to a refined hypothesis about literacy and\ud
culture, which leads me to consider theories of literacy now current in order to\ud
find an adequate model of what literacy is. I conclude that literacies are contextually\ud
and therefore culturally located. I then discuss theories of culture and psychology\ud
in order to find an adequate way to make comparisons with pupil literacies in\ud
Milton Keynes. The empirical examination of these hypothetical engagements is\ud
best done by an ethnographic method. Case studies of literacy learners in Milton\ud
Keynes in a thick description of their school and the uses of literacy current in its\ud
cultures are presented. In my conclusion, I suggest a mismatch between the official\ud
literacy offered as part of the 'newness' of Milton Keynes and the cultural literate\ud
practices of its inhabitants"

214,Invisible children : a study of policy exclusion,"This research investigated a particular Government of India policy, known as the\ud
Integrated Child Development Scheme (or the ICDS). The ICDS operates amongst the\ud
poorer sections of the population in India, for pre-school children in the age range of\ud
0-6 years. The IeDS policy, although it states that it is for 'all' children, does not in\ud
practice, address the question of disabled children. The research examined why and\ud
how such a major social policy in the country has omitted the disabled child from its\ud
agenda. It examined the socio-cultural attitudes towards disability in the Indian subcontinent\ud
and explored the wider historical, political and ideological framework in\ud
which Indian social policy for the disabled exists and within which the IeDS policy\ud
and practice may have become embedded.\ud
Data collection included exploratory field visits; focus group discussions;\ud
triangulations by follow-up interviews; semi-structured interviews; analysis of\ud
historical and current documents.\ud
The investigation concludes with the finding that various factors have led to\ud
disabled children being left out of the IeDS programmes. In the specific context of\ud
the IeDS, although it may have been the intention to include disabled children in the\ud
term 'all' children, there is a gap between policy stated and policy enacted, as the\ud
IeDS does not include them, in practice. The findings indicate that, due to ill-defined\ud
policy objectives during the policy formulation stage, policy remains silent on the\ud
issue, not clarifying that 'all' means disabled children as well. Implementation\ud
strategies for the inclusion of these children therefore are not worked out, which leads\ud
to the non-inclusion of disabled children from the programmes. In the wider context,\ud
the findings indicate that the national policy concerning disabled children lacks\ud
cohesion and does not give clear directives for the implementation of inclusion to take\ud
place. The Government's conceptualisation of disabled children is full of ambiguity\ud
and confusion: governmental reliance on voluntary organisations to deliver services\ud
ensures a micro-level coverage and indicates a lack of philosophical commitment to\ud
the integrated education of disabled children. Non-Government Organisations\ud
(NGOs) and their concentration on the delivery of services move the issue away from\ud
2\ud
a rights approach, leading to a disempowerment and depoliticisation of the disabled\ud
group. This takes the matter out of the public domain, making it a politically weak\ud
group and placing it within a charity framework. Negative attitudes, ignorance and a\ud
lack of awareness that prevails towards disability have also contributed to an overall\ud
ideological and cultural entrenchment in the subcontinent, contributing to\ud
marginalisation. The absence of a clear policy directive has left this segment of the\ud
population at a critical age out of the programmes of the ICDS.\u"
215,Naturalistic decision-making frameworks in multiprofessional assessment of early childhood disability,"Young children with complex developmental difficulties are often referred for\ud
assessment by multiprofessional groups run by health or education services.\ud
The purpose of this research is to identify and describe the frameworks within\ud
which such groups make their judgements and decisions in real work settings.\ud
This study adopted an exploratory, multiple-case research design. It involved\ud
two tertiary multiprofessional groups in London. Each assessed two preschool\ud
children whose difficulties were suspected to lie within the autistic spectrum.\ud
One group consisted of a paediatric senior registrar, a clinical psychologist and\ud
a speech therapist working within a neurodisability centre attached to a\ud
hospital (Site M); the other group was multi-agency, managed by an\ud
Educational Psychology Service and included educational psychologists, a\ud
psychotherapist and the deputy head of a special school (Site E). Each child\ud
was assessed by all the professionals simultaneously in the presence of the\ud
parents over a morning session. All discussions were audio-recorded. Postassessment\ud
interviews were held with each participant. Data were subjected\ud
to verbal protocol analysis and discourse and conversation analysis.\ud
The major finding of the study was that professionals made use of four types\ud
of interlinked decision-making frameworks, activated either concurrently or in\ud
close alternation. Firstly, a common procedural framework included\ud
hypothesis testing and diagnosis carried out in three cycles of decision\ud
making, with varying characteristics related to the different institutional\ud
contexts of each Site. Secondly, knowledge frameworks were mainly within\ud
the 'disease' model at Site M, and the 'psychodynamic' and 'behavioural'\ud
models at Site E. Thirdly, goal structures were related to which client and\ud
purpose each assessment was intended to serve. Finally, negotiation\ud
frameworks consisted of inter-professional collaboration and power-game\ud
structures, and professional-parent interaction structures for negotiating the\ud
bad news. These findings have implications for research on decision making\ud
in assessment of children with disability, as well as for professional practice\ud
and training"
216,Child protection and independent day care services : examining the interface of policy and practice,"This thesis adopted a tripartite analysis of child protection policy and independent day care practice incorporating three types of evidence including an historical policy analysis, a contemporary policy analysis and analysis of new empirical data from independent day care providers.\ud
\ud
The theoretical framework incorporated a view of power in social policy that allowed for multiple perspectives on, and sources of control over, the direction of policy, and a perspective on caring that emphasised the social relations of caring alongside the human activity of caring.\ud
\ud
Policy recipients were seen as significant social actors, whose views on policy implementation provided an important contributing voice in an evaluation of policy in practice.\ud
\ud
The policy analysis began by noting that the two fields of child protection and day care had developed in parallel, overlapping rarely, but were brought together in the Children Act 1989. Public policies in the field of child welfare have long identified a potential or actual role for public day care services in preventing abuse, but the implications in practice for such a role being undertaken by independent day care services has not been explored in practice. The study found that while there is little evidence of formal policy implementation, following the publication of Working Together (Home Office et al., 1991), about 20% of a sample of 49 day care providers had had experience of child protection nvestigations on their premises. A further 30% had experience of making referrals to, or caring for children on behalf of social services departments.\ud
\ud
Key themes used to explore the operation of the policy in practice were the particular structural contexts of independent day care services, social relations between providers and parents, and the implications of these for the policy objective of `partnership'"

218,The use of silence by Japanese learners of English in cross-cultural communication and its pedagogical implications,"This thesis examinest he use of silence by Japanese learners of English in cross-cultural communication. It also considers how cross-cultural misunderstandings can be avoided in a pedagogic context. To this end, an analysis is made of a contrastive study of the use of silence by Japanese students learning English, and by Western students learning Japanese. The study draws on insights from the ethnographic approach. The study consists of three parts. The first part, Chapters 1-4, investigates the theoretical\ud
background to the study. Chapter 1 examines various definitions of the word 'culture' and investigates the role of Pragmatics in cross-cultural communication. Chapter 2 surveys studies of silence in various socio-cultural contexts. Chapter 3 more specifically explores the use of silence in the Japanese context and its relation to Japanese\ud
cultural values and sociocultural norms. Then, Chapter 4 shifts attention to examine differences of communicative styles between Japanese and Westerners, and several important features in interaction.\ud
In part two, Chapters 5-8, the ethnographic approach takes the lead in the interpretation of the interview and observational material. Chapter 5 offers an overview of the study and carefully considers the principles of ethnography guiding this investigation. Chapter 6 considers the research design in relation to the context and purposes of the investigation. The data is analysed in Chapters 7 and 8 interpreting the use of silence from a socio-cultural perspective.\ud
Chapter 7 discusses the results of the questionnaires. Chapter 8 concentrates on the analysis of the video-recorded data. The last Chapter, Chapter 9, concludes with suggestions of possible pedagogic approaches tackling cross-cultural misunderstanding in foreign language learning"

221,"Globalization, curriculum and international student communities : a case study of the United World College of the Atlantic","This thesis explores micro-level effects of globalization in the domain of education.\ud
Specifically, it seeks a deeper understanding of the dynamics between international\ud
education and human attitudes and behaviour in the context of an international student\ud
community. The research is based on a case study of the United World College of the\ud
Atlantic - an international pre-university college in Wales, which has a demonstrable\ud
commitment to international education.\ud
The central research proposition can be stated as follows:\ud
Curricular and pedagogical interventions which aim to:\ud
(i) transmit a vision of an interdependent global society;\ud
(ii) promote an ethic of service;\ud
(iii) preserve cultural heritage; and\ud
(iv) promote international understanding\ud
are effective tools for the development of globally oriented, participatory student\ud
communities.\ud
The research indicates that a number of curricular and pedagogical interventions which\ud
pertain to (i) - (iv) above, hold potential for the development of globally oriented,\ud
participatory student communities. The findings suggest that:\ud
• The concept of 'vision' is multifaceted requiring analysis in four dimensions: an\ud
idealistic vision; a vision of the current world situation; a vision of the Atlantic\ud
College community; and a vision of human potential.\ud
• Interventions associated with service-learning appear to stimulate development in\ud
four areas: character building, skill formation, social relations and international\ud
understanding.\ud
• Values education - bearing on the preservation of cultural heritage and the\ud
promotion of international understanding - is transmitted through a 'pedagogy of philosophical inquiry' and reflects a relativist epistemological position. Such an\ud
approach to values education poses dilemmas in a pluralist community.\ud
The concept of citizenship - at local, national and international levels - is an\ud
underlying theme.\ud
The working definition of international education adopted in this thesis is stated thus:\ud
International education is a transformative discourse which locates all fields of enquiry\ud
in a supranational frame of reference and upholds the cause of peace.\ud
Key words: globalization, curriculum, international student communities, United\ud
World College of the Atlantic, international education, values education, citizenship\ud
education, pedagogy"
222,Teacher formative assessment : influences and practice case study research at the year one level,"This case study research investigated the formative assessment practices of four Year One teachers in one local education authority, and the influences which have shaped their skills. School-level contextual factors such as\ud
the role of colleagues, the head teacher, and experience in the classroom were investigated through interview and questionnaire. External influences on teacher\ud
practice, most specifically the influence of the National Curriculum and its assessment requirements, were also examined. The findings identified experience in the classroom and colleagues as key sources of influence on practice.\ud
The study reviewed the current understanding of formative\ud
assessment from social-constructivist perspective on learning. Research has illustrated specific elements of formative assessment practice, including the development of learning goals, communicating criteria, feedback, and the role of discourse. In this research, questioning emerged as a vital formative assessment skill. Underpinning the practice of the teachers who demonstrated the widest\ud
range of strategies were three key features. These teachers were reflective about their own daily practice, and demonstrated a problem-solving approach to teaching and learning. Lastly, they had established a collegial relationship of shared power in which pupil and teacher thinking processes and ideas could be expressed and exchanged. \ud
Theory has pointed to formative assessment as a teacher practice embedded in planning, teaching and assessing. Case study data were analysed to describe the practices of the teachers and to understand the ways in which formative assessment strategies might be linked together. A model of integrated practice is developed from the analysis, useful for teacher development and further research"

224,Values and the curriculum : economics and business education at different stages in the development of young people,"This thesis presents an account of curriculum initiatives in the related fields of\ud
economics and business education between the years 1982 to 1998. These\ud
developments are placed in the context of a national curriculum for schools in\ud
England and Wales, rapid changes in the post-16 education and training environment\ud
and alterations in working practices brought about by the information and\ud
communication revolution.\ud
The work employs a pluralist methodology based on fitness for purpose. Thus, the\ud
national scene largely relies on documentary sources, whilst the case studies are\ud
examined through the use of interviews and questionnaires as well as secondary data.\ud
In one example the author is a participant observer. The central theme is the\ud
relationship between business education curricula and values: the account of\ud
curriculum developments are subject to analysis both of the values that have\ud
underpinned or guided their contents and the contribution that their configurations of\ud
business education can make to values education. It introduces the notion of\ud
'congruence' in curriculum development, a term used to describe the interface between\ud
curriculum, values and the development of young people.\ud
The thesis is in the most part an original contribution to the study of curriculum and\ud
curriculum development. In identifying the key concept, 'values', and analysing the\ud
degree of 'congruence' achieved by curriculum developers, the thesis is able to\ud
contribute to the literature on values education and the development of young people.\ud
In particular, the final chapter shows the potential of business education to promote in\ud
young people an understanding that values underpin and help to explain the workings\ud
of the economic world.\ud
The main conclusions are two-fold. First, that value positions underpin curriculum\ud
developments but that they are not always made explicit, even in subjects dealing with\ud
business and economic systems. Second, that business education curricula need to\ud
demonstrate more overtly their role in encouraging the critique of values alongside\ud
more fact based enquiry. The research shows that development of young people is\ud
only considered as a by-product of other aims and objectives, which results in a\ud
missed opportunity. The holistic perspective examining the intellectual and emotional\ud
needs of a 'complete' student and what this means at various stages of the educational\ud
process (from 14 years-old), is rarely considered when curriculum change is\ud
contemplated"
225,"Learning strategies and materials selection in the English for tourism classroom : a study of learning strategies employed by learners in the British context, with consideration of implications for published materials selection","There are two enquiries undertaken in this work which is an investigation of\ud
learning strategies employed by students of English for Tourism in the British\ud
context, and an evaluation of textbooks already used for teaching this programme\ud
in Taiwan and relevant ones published in the United Kingdom. It is hoped that this\ud
work will have direct implications for pedagogy and learning processes of the\ud
English for Tourism programme in the Taiwanese context.\ud
This thesis is made up of four parts. The first part is Chapter 1 which investigates\ud
general broad backgrounds in the Taiwanese context. It also deals with the debate\ud
on the improvement of English language teaching in this context. It further\ud
discusses how this context relates to this work.\ud
The second part includes Chapters 2, 3, and 4, offering the theoretical framework\ud
on which an empirical research and a desk-based study of textbooks are based.\ud
Chapter 2 primarily examines the features of English for Tourism by taking account\ud
of the general key issues of ESP relevant to needs analysis, content and language,\ud
and methodology, and the specific crucial issues in relation to the target situation\ud
in the tourism industry, tourism education and training, and cultural content. It\ud
further postulates that communicative language teaching and learning strategies\ud
are closely relevant to the efficiency of ESP teaching. These are defined and\ud
explored in depth in Chapters 3 and 4 respectively.\ud
The third part consists of an empirical research and a desk-based study (Chapters\ud
5, 6, 7, 8 and 9). Chapter 5 discusses research methodology indicating that a\ud
qualitative approach has been preferred to a quantitative approach. The empirical\ud
research will be based on participant observations (Chapter 6) and semi-structured\ud
interviews (Chapter 7). It will be followed by a desk-based study of textbooks\ud
(Chapter 9). Chapters 6 and 7 are mainly descriptive. Chapter 8 interprets the\ud
major findings of this empirical research, discusses the issues they raise and goes\ud
on to suggest improvements to the pedagogy and learning processes in the\ud
Taiwanese context. It indicates that social strategies and social interaction bothinside and outside the classroom are the most significant factors for learning\ud
processes. It suggests furthermore that a combination model of notional-functional\ud
and task-based approaches is essential for the effective English for Tourism\ud
syllabuses and methodologies in the Taiwanese context. Chapter 9 is a desk-based\ud
study of textbooks to evaluate and select appropriate and useful textbook for\ud
teaching English for Tourism in the Taiwanese context.\ud
The final part is Chapter 10. This chapter reviews the principal themes in the\ud
preceding chapters, and offers principles of approach which guide the teaching and\ud
learning of English for Tourism in the Taiwanese context"

228,"An examination of the links between the pedagogical culture of primary schools, school effectiveness and school improvement","This study examines the proposition that values and beliefs about teaching and\ud
learning are of critical importance in determining pupil outcomes. Using a sample of\ud
teaching staff from 32 primary schools, I attempt to identify these beliefs and their links\ud
with school effectiveness and school improvement. School effectiveness is measured in\ud
terms of pupil progress on Suffolk Reading Tests taken at 6+ and 8+ from 1994-6. Data\ud
about pedagogical values and beliefs were collected using interviews, questionnaires and\ud
Ofsted reports. An outlier framework was used to analyse effectiveness and\ud
improvement, and to determine if either was associated with a pedagogical culture based\ud
upon the ideology of progressivism which the work of Plowden and Piaget supposedly\ud
spawned during the early 1970s. It has been argued that this ideology still continues to\ud
influence primary practice and has been largely responsible for a perceived decline in\ud
standards of literacy.\ud
The results of this study suggest that differences in pedagogical culture between\ud
outlier groups are not nearly as wide ranging as some critics of primary practice suggest.\ud
However, although the differences may be few, they may still explain the apparent\ud
divergence in effectiveness since they appear to relate to pedagogical goals, methods,\ud
and certain leadership strategies. Differences between schools in which the rate of pupil\ud
progress improved substantially between 1994-6 and those in which it declined,\ud
appeared even less marked.\ud
This study also explores the challenges involved in linking research into school\ud
effectiveness with school improvement, and suggests that the lack of synergy between\ud
the two, particularly in the sphere of teaching and learning, can be partly transcended\ud
through the concept of pedagogical culture which is common to both fields of enquiry.\ud
The study concludes by positing a model that uses pedagogical culture to link both the\ud
school effectiveness and school improvement paradigms"
229,The relationship between teachers and government in curriculum development in Korea and England,"This thesis examines teachers' perceptions of the relationship between teachers and\ud
government in the field of curriculum development, in the light of changes in the mode of\ud
curriculum control under which teachers carry out their work in Korea and England. In\ud
both countries, major recent legislation has brought about fundamental revisions of the\ud
curriculum. In Korea, the 1992 sixth National Curriculum declared a decentralization of\ud
curriculum development, ostensibly attempting to decrease government control over\ud
teachers. In England, the 1988 Education Act imposed a national curriculum: this\ud
represented an increase in government control over teachers.\ud
The thesis begins with a review of theoretical work relating to modes of curriculum control\ud
and professionalism. It then offers accounts of the historical and cultural context of\ud
curriculum development and professionalism in Korea and England, providing overviews\ud
of curriculum development, teacher education relating to curriculum development,\ud
teachers' organizations, hierarchies in society and schools, gender differences in the\ud
teaching profession, inspection of teachers, and teachers' relations with parents.\ud
A central issue for the thesis is the idea of teachers' professionalism in relation to\ud
government intervention in curriculum development. It is the main assumption of the study\ud
that teachers' professionalism in the field of curriculum control can be best analysed\ud
through an examination of the context in which it is embedded. Thus, this thesis involves\ud
empirical studies of structured samples of six primary schools in Korea and nine primary\ud
schools in England; questionnaires, interviews and case studies were administered in both\ud
countries. These investigations focus on comparing the teachers' perceptions of curriculum\ud
&-YQlppment. and professionalism in their different cultural contexts. Comparison serves\ud
to improve contextual understanding of teachers' professionalism within two different\ud
trends: centralization and decentralization.\ud
Examination of the empirical data reveals both similarities and differences between\ud
different teachers within each country, and also between teachers in the two countries.\ud
Overall, Korean teachers feel that they have only a restricted role in implementing the new\ud
curriculum in their own classroom, despite the recent change which introduced some\ud
decentralization in curriculum policy.. Compared with this situation in Korea, despite\ud
governmental intervention in curriculum development the majority of English teachers may\ud
be characterized as still having an autonomous role in implementing the curriculum.\ud
Although there were different orientations and degrees of control among both groups of\ud
teachers, the belief in the desirability of teacher control of the curriculum has been a\ud
dominant perspective with widespread acceptance in the two countries.\ud
This thesis supports the view that teachers' professionalism is shaped by social, political,\ud
educational and institutional cultures in a very complicated fashion, and cannot be\ud
expected to change quickly or easily. It also demonstrates that teachers' professionalism\ud
cannot be conceptualized simply in terms of movement along the continuum between\ud
centralization and decentralization. The thesis argues that teachers' professionalism in\ud
relation to government intervention is affected much more by-what teachers think, which\ud
is shaped in their own cultural contexts, than by the nature of the change itself as defined\ud
by the legislation/Accordingly, it suggests that the strategies for enhancing teachers'\ud
professionalism in relation to curriculum development should be considered with reference\ud
to the cultural contexts within which they are practised"

232,Transfiguring fantasy : spiritual development in the work of George MacDonald,"This study addresses two questions. What light does the work of George MacDonald shed\ud
on the concept of 'spiritual development' and what is the pedagogical function of his\ud
fantasy? The thesis is largely concerned to clarify these conceptual issues but the reason for\ud
raising them is practical. The promotion of spiritual development in schools is a statutory\ud
requirement. The conclusions of this thesis contain implications for curricular strategies for\ud
meeting that requirement and attention will be drawn to them.\ud
Two major claims are made. The first concerns the issue of whether a coherent spirituality\ud
necessarily depends on - and thus must be promoted within - a religious framework. The\ud
implication of MacDonald's recourse to fantasy, a discourse dispensing with traditional\ud
religious categories, to explore the theme of spiritual development is that a spiritual\ud
pedagogy does not need to be rooted in traditional religious concepts and truth-claims. The\ud
two discourses, the 'theistic' and the 'non-theistic', are compatible and complementary.\ud
Secondly, the concept of 'transfiguring fantasy' is introduced and commended.\ud
MacDonald's transfiguring fantasy functions pedagogically, as potentially does all such\ud
unclosed flmtasy, by calling in question the distinction between the narrative one reads and\ud
one's own life-story. The two realms, those of the text in one's hands and the life one is\ud
leading, elide and the task of resolving the enigmas of the fantasy becomes one with the\ud
unfinished business of making sense of one's own story.\ud
This thesis also considers the familiar Romantic themes of nature, childhood and the\ud
imagination, which MacDonald treats with original insight. Nature is akin to fantasy in its\ud
capacity to engage and direct the attentive spirit. Childhood is the pattern of what we must\ud
become. The imagination's role is to summon us to press beyond the borders of what may\ud
be scientifically proven or rationally articulated.\u"

234,A comparison of English and Chinese written discourse and its implications for teaching,"This thesis sets out to compare paragraph progressIOn of\ud
English and Chinese expository writing in order to verify the\ud
validity of Kaplan's claim that Chinese essays are organised\ud
differently from English ones.\ud
Different from most existing work, this project uses\ud
quantitative data analysis methods with samples selected at\ud
random in order to make the results more objective and\ud
persuasIve. Based on Kaplan's concept of the discourse bloc,\ud
each sample passage is segregated into a number of functional\ud
meamng units. The second step is to determine the relationship\ud
between each unit and the theme of the passage they appear in\ud
by using the list of relation definitions devised by Mann and\ud
Thompson as part of their Rhetorical Structure Theory.\ud
This project aims to achieve two goals. One, from a more\ud
practical angle, is to conduct a contrastive study of Chinese and\ud
English at rhetorical level so as to improve the teaching and\ud
learning of Chinese by English speakers. The other is to carry\ud
out an experiment on the application of Rhetorical Structure\ud
Theory at discourse level.\ud
The results have shown no existence of ""illogical""\ud
information in Chinese writing as observed by Kaplan. The\ud
conclusion is that Chinese and English expository writing, as\ud
represented by the samples selected from newspaper editorials,\ud
are organised in very similar ways.\u"

237,Accessing education : a feminist post/structuralist ethnography of widening educational participation.\ud,"This thesis represents a small-scale ethnography of access education. Using methods of auto/biography, I study the field of access education through students' life stories, spoken narratives and diary entries, while writing myself and aspects of my own auto/biography into the research. My analytical approach is framed by feminist post/structural theories, drawing on analytical tools such as deconstruction and discourse analysis and conceptual tools including power, collaboration through praxis, reflexivity, subjectivity and experience. The thesis focuses on a group of students returning to learning through various 'access courses' available at their local FE College within the context of burgeoning national policy on widening educational participation. In examining the competing discourses within the field of access education, it reveals the hidden dynamics in which access students are re/positioned in complex, contradictory and multiple ways. The research examines the implications of educational participation for access students and explores the effectiveness of interactive and collaborative approaches to the research and education of marginalised groups. The ethnography situates students and researcher as co-participants. Placing mature students' representations of educational experiences at the centre of knowledge production, the thesis argues that we must understand the backgrounds, interests and experiences of the particular social groups that policy seeks to target. I argue for the revitalisation of lively discussions about pedagogy within access education rooted in reflexive praxis that are committed to a politics of difference and to anticlassist, anti(hetero )sexist and antiracist practices. New forms of access practices that are inclusive and responsive to fluidity and context are presented through the insights of co-participants"

240,'Undergraduates' expectations of economic and other benefits of higher education : a case study of Hong Kong,"Hong Kong started a major expansion of its higher education\ud
system in 1989. By 1996, in less than a decade, the student enrolment\ud
rate had reached 18% of the relevant age group. Was there a\ud
justification for further expansion?\ud
This thesis investigates the issue of the demand for higher\ud
education from the perspective of the students during the 1 990s, a\ud
period of drastic political change and difficult economic conditions. It\ud
was an interesting time to explore students' perceptions of economic\ud
and other benefits of university education. The assumption was that if\ud
students possess positive views of returns from higher education, even\ud
in critical periods, their motive for investing in higher education is at\ud
least partly instrumental.\ud
The findings of the study reveal that students were realistic and\ud
informed about the future graduate labour market. They were aware of\ud
the financial hardships incurred from the increase in their own share of\ud
the cost of higher education, the intensifying competition in the future\ud
graduate labour market resulting from education expansion, the\ud
possible impact the political changes and the economic downturn after\ud
1997 might have on their future career conditions. Many foresaw and\ud
were ready to accept diminishing immediate economic returns upon\ud
graduation. Yet most of them still maintained a positive view of long\ud
term earnings and career development. Most of them understood that\ud
their investment in higher education was a prerequisite for a better\ud
future both in economic terms and in terms of life long personal\ud
development. All in all, the findings of this study provide evidence to\ud
support the instrumentalists' idea, not to exclude the academicians'\ud
though, an individual perceives participating in higher education as\ud
making investment for his/her future pecuniary returns and/or other\ud
benefits"
241,Television realism : a semiotic approach,"This thesis reconceptualises the concept of realism in relation to television using\ud
a semiotic approach. The Thesis proposes that ""realism"" may be used as a tool\ud
for the understanding of the place of television texts in the legitimation and\ud
representation of social relations.\ud
The theoretical approach is based on semiotic work that foregrounds the social\ud
constitution of meaning; particularly the work of Barthes on myth, Bakhtin, Kress\ud
and Volosinov. From film studies, Bordwell and Nichols are also used. The\ud
concepts drawn from their work are applied to a reformulation of realism in direct\ud
reference to the signifiers of television texts. Realism is considered in the light of\ud
these theories as not one specific form but as a property of all texts: of how a\ud
represented ""world"" is constructed and understood in social life.\ud
The study focuses on a small number of the totality of semiotic resources that\ud
contribute to the construction of realism in television: camera movement, camera\ud
stability and camera position, shot duration and continuity. It provides a detailed\ud
transcription and analysis of a number of television texts from different theme\ud
areas: the news, police drama and documentary and a game/quiz show.\ud
I propose in this thesis that the use of semiotic resources in different ways in\ud
different texts produces distinct realisms that in their represented ""world"" express\ud
certain values and interests in respect of wider social relations of power.Television texts are therefore the product of changing social environments and\ud
the resources used in their production represent this"
242,The role of social and cultural capital in choice making for post secondary school destinations : the case of contemporary Cyprus,"This study investigates the choices that students coming from different social\ud
backgrounds and from the full range of secondary schools in Cyprus make regarding\ud
their post school destinations. It is based on a theory, which regards the family as a\ud
central agency in the reproduction of inequalities. This study argues that apart from\ud
making the most of their financial capital, Cypriot families utillse intentionally or in\ud
an unintended manner the non-monetary capitals they may have available such as\ud
their cultural capital and more importantly their social capital to produce social\ud
'profits' for the education of their offspring. Social capital is seen as a major factor\ud
that can explain the unequal pattern of educational choices made by the growing\ud
ranks of students coming from -different social origins regarding their post school\ud
destinations. Different families adopt various strategies to cope with the lack of that\ud
resource and it appears that some families have more options to consider than others.\ud
The differential ability to cope with the lack of social capital constitutes a source of\ud
social differentiation. The mobilisation of various resources is examined in a social\ud
environment whereby for the past three or four decades went through a process of\ud
modermsation. This rapid transition has led to the co-existence of traditional and\ud
modernist perspectives of how social relations and gender issues are perceived.\ud
Adherence to one or another perspective affects the strategies that families employ\ud
for their children's educational prospects.\ud
This research used a multiple or mixed method approach combining quantitative and\ud
qualitative methodologies in a complimentary manner. A stratified sample of 404\ud
students graduating from all kinds of secondary schools and their parents completed\ud
questionnaires. A selected sample of 24 parents was interviewed. The findings of the\ud
study indicate that choice making varies across social class and is influenced by\ud
gender. Of the non-monetary resources investigated social capital appears to act as a\ud
hidden mechanism of social selection in modem Cyprus particularly because it\ud
allows for the creation of a certain habitus that allows some privileged families and\ud
students mostly from middle class backgrounds to make far reaching and daring\ud
decisions which offer them the possibility for social success in a competitive and\ud
4close' labour market whereas at the same time it makes others from lower social\ud
class backgrounds to make 'pragmatic' choices which often mean making\ud
compromises in their ambitions to achieve social success"

244,The impact of age of entry to school on boys' reading attitudes and skills during Key Stage One,"British children enter school earlier than their European counterparts. According to\ud
statutory guidelines they must commence school in the term following their fifth\ud
birthday. In reality Local Education Authority policy has fostered a trend towards\ud
earlier admission, with most children in school at four or four and a half. Research\ud
suggests that this disadvantages boys who may be unready for formal literacy\ud
instruction and in particular summer-born boys, the youngest cohort in the year group.\ud
This longitudinal study explores the effect of age of entry to school on boys' reading\ud
development, focussing on attitudes as well as achievement. Adopting both\ud
quantitative and qualitative methodologies the study examined this development\ud
within a sample of 60, summer-born boys as they moved through Key Stage One. The\ud
boys were drawn randomly from 18 schools within six Local Education Authorities\ud
operating different admissions policies. Comparisons were drawn between 31 boys\ud
with part-time Nursery education before Year One, and 29 with full-time Reception\ud
class experience. Collection of data commenced in 1998, so that the National Literacy\ud
Strategy governed the sample's school literacy experiences in Years One and Two.\ud
Data was collected from the boys and their parents on three occasions: before entry to\ud
Year One, at the end of Year One and the end of Year Two. The study illustrates the\ud
impact of commencing school on boys' reading attitudes both directly and through the\ud
triadic relationship established between school, parents and children. It traces the\ud
development of boys' reading attitudes over time as the sample's experiences became\ud
more uniform and analyses the long-term impact of early entry into school. Contrary\ud
to parental belief as examined through parental interview and questionnaires, boys\ud
who commenced school earlier were not advantaged in terms of reading achievement.\ud
The data suggest that an early start to school was accompanied by heightened adult\ud
expectations (both parents' and teachers'), of which the boys became keenly aware.\ud
This affected the boys' attitudes toward reading and their reading routines, often\ud
acting detrimentally on their reading development. The study examines the\ud
implications of these findings for school admission policies"
245,Teaching literature to Greek adult learners : an integrated approach making use of reader response theory and discourse analysis for the English foreign language classroom,"The thesis is making use of a well-known literary theory and discourse\ud
analysis, so as to introduce literature to Greek adult learners of English as a\ud
foreign language who are preparing for the Cambridge Proficiency\ud
Examination in English as a Foreign Language. Chapter one introduces the\ud
thesis problem and the questions arising from it. Chapter two presents the\ud
learning situation in Greece at this advanced level and deals with linguistic\ud
theory and syllabus design. In chapter three, four of the most important literary\ud
theories are presented, including reader response theory, which is adopted\ud
here as the most appropriate mode in EFL teaching. Chapter four makes an\ud
attempt to integrate reader response theory and discourse analysis so as to\ud
present literary texts to Greek adult learners of English of an advanced level\ud
with the aim of emphasizing the advantages offered by such an integration. A\ud
literature course design is presented in chapter five, which, it is claimed, can\ud
be incorporated as a supplementary course in the general language syllabus;\ud
the texts introduced are approached from two main viewpoints, an analysis of\ud
their discourse and an emphasis on the reader, as advocated by reader\ud
response theory. Chapter six introduces a small-scale research based on the\ud
piece of curriculum development in the previous chapter, with 25 students from\ud
the University of Piraeus treated as 'focus students ', while in the next chapter\ud
the findings are discussed and placed against the background of the course\ud
design and the objectives identified. Such issues as external validity, reliability\ud
and extending the course are dealt with in the last chapter, where a discussion\ud
is held in the form of reflections about the findings. Finally, in the conclusion,\ud
proposals are made for the importance of including literature in the foreign\ud
language classroom and the approach that should be adopted"

247,Modern languages : which identities? which selves?,"Academic identities in modem languages in the British higher education system may be\ud
understood as an interaction between three domains: the institutional, the epistemological\ud
and the ontological.\ud
This model, initially developed at the beginning stages of the research, was refined\ud
through subsequent field work. It comprised both the ways in which respondents\ud
construct the institutions and disciplinary field in which they operate (which I call, in\ud
tum, institutional and field identities) and the sense of the self that academics create by\ud
positioning themselves within institutional and field structures and discourses in relation\ud
to their personal histories, values and beliefs.\ud
Staff of the languages departments of three English universities were interviewed in the\ud
process of data collection. The outcome is a pattern which reflects the complex interplay\ud
between institutional identities, field identities and selves. It is through the interaction\ud
between identities and selves that the academic identity is built in each of the universities\ud
perused.\ud
Using concepts taken from constructivist-realism, the personal dimension emerges as\ud
paramount in two senses. Firstly, it represents the lens through which the institutional and\ud
field domains are both understood and constructed by the respondents. Secondly, it offers\ud
a heuristic research device that assists in capturing the kind of personal and professional\ud
self individual academics develop as they position themselves within institutional and\ud
field discourses, and identify (or not) with some of these.\ud
It emerges that the more institutional structures are stable, yet supple enough to\ud
accommodate academics' values, the more academics' selves acquire a creative force that\ud
benefits, ultimately, both the institution and the disciplinary field at large"
248,"Forming post-compulsory subject choices in school : a longitudinal study of changes in secondary school students' ideas, with particular reference to choice about science","The research in this thesis examined the basis of young people's decision making. A longitudinal study involving periodic interviews addressed questions about how changes in secondary school students' ideas led to decisions about elective education by individuals in mid-adolescence, particularly with reference to science. \ud
Analysis of interview data captured changes in students' ideas over time and a new way of looking at post- 16 choice was developed that gives a more indepth picture of how students' ideas are formed than has hitherto been achieved. The ways in which students' educational objectives were driven by different ideas and the ways in which students engaged with influences on decisionmaking were used to develop a typology of choice trajectories. The typology unearths variations in the temporal characteristics of young people's thinking about choice. \ud
Five types of choice trajectory were identified. Students with a 'directed' trajectory had a demonstrably stable commitment to a specific career direction inspired by a critical influence at an early age. The 'partially resolved' trajectory was that of a student with identifiable vocational leanings prompted by positive dispositions towards some school subjects and related careers. The 'funnelling identifier' trajectory was shaped by a gradual identification with a domain of interest whereas that of 'multiple projection' was characterised by favouring different careers at different times. The student with a 'precipitating' trajectory lacked critical influences, had diffuse ideas and aimed for broad and versatile choices. Application of the typology to four portraits of students who chose science demonstrated that science was chosen in a variety of ways. \ud
In conclusion, the thesis raises issues for discussion about the impact of choice support mechanisms in schools, particularly in relation to careers guidance and within science teaching. \u"

251,Towards a framework for the analysis of CSCL (computer supported co-operative learning) discourse,"The thesis aims to develop a possible description of electronic discourse in CSCL\ud
through a data-driven description of the linguistic behaviour and discourse strategies of 4\ud
groups of postgraduate students engaged in an asynchronous CSCL task during-February\ud
2000 and February 2001.\ud
The study develops an analytic framework for the coding of the messages. The\ud
framework consists of three levels, with a default inheritance relationship between these\ud
levels. The top level concerns the aim of the messages, identified within the broad\ud
context of Levinson's Activity Type. The mid-level consists of the traditional\ud
conversational analysis categories, with some minor adaptations to the CMC medium.\ud
The third level is based on a neo-Gricean approach to utterance interpretation, with\ud
special attention to Levinson's (2000) theory of generalised conversational implicature.\ud
The analysis was conducted through intensive reading of the coded data to identify\ud
categories of speaker behaviour. The categories were then collated to address the research\ud
question. 19 categories were identified, covering 4 aspects of discourse behaviour.\ud
As an additional test of the discourse analysis framework, the coded output was used as\ud
data for a separate theory-driven question. The question was to seek evidence of\ud
behaviour typical of the iterative dialogue that characterises Laurillard's (2002) model of\ud
learning through conversational dialogue.\ud
The research study found that the majority of the discourse categories identified by the\ud
framework are valid, although some need to be refined. In particular, 4 basic message\ud
structure types, and distinctive patterns in the use of indirect and direct forms of\ud
expression are clearly identified in this data. There are also clear indicators of strategies\ud
used to maintain cohesion and coherence. In the test case, the coded data was used to\ud
identify six types of critical learning behaviour that are broadly consistent with\ud
Laurillard's model of learning"
252,The use of gesture by young children and their teachers : a classroom based study of gestural behaviours in grouped tasks,"Background: It is not currently known how Year 1 Primary school pupils\ud
and their teachers use activity-related-gestures and targeting, during group-based\ud
task-activity in a working classroom.\ud
Airn: To explore this context using two teacher 'settings': 'teacher-out-of-the-group'\ud
(TOG) and 'teacher-in-the-group' JIG), informed by an ecological, affordancesbased,\ud
psychological perspective.\ud
Sample: Twenty-five observations of pupil groups (12 TOG, 13 TIG), involving two\ud
schools, four teachers and 49 pupils, working in groups of up to six pupils.\ud
Method: Non-video-based, systematic, participant observation in working\ud
classrooms.\ud
Results: No statistical differences were apparent when girls' and boys' mean use of\ud
particular categories of gesture, targeting and task-activity were compared\ud
(underlying variability between participants may have influenced this lack of\ud
difference). Significant differences with their teachers were apparent. However,\ud
within and between settings, and within task-groups, some evidence of subtle\ud
differences between girls' and boys' overall gesture-use, targeting and task-activity\ud
profiles were identified. Extensive differences with their teachers were also apparent.\ud
Correlation analysis revealed that girls and boys showed limited and different\ud
associations in the two settings. Case studies revealed that a teacher, when part of a\ud
group, became the principal target for gestural activity, dominating pupil gestural and\ud
targeting activity. Limited evidence suggested that Partnering could affect gestural\ud
activity and task-activity. Teachers overwhelmingly used speech, rather than gesture,\ud
for communicative purposes, particularly in the TIG setting. Pupils used more\ud
gesture than did teachers in both settings.\ud
Conclusions: Teacher and pupil role, pupil gender, task-structure, using shared\ud
resources and, to some extent, partnering, are key factors relating to pupil and\ud
teacher gesture-use, targeting and task-activity. Arguably girls, boys and teachers\ud
bring different saliencies and expectations to the same group activities, as revealed\ud
in their gesture-use, targeting and task-activity. The implications for classroom\ud
practice, and gesture-in-action in the working classroom, are discussed"
253,"Knowledge, activity and mediation : a critique of the 'knowledge economy' thesis and its implications for a social theory of pedagogy","This thesis is concerned with the educational response to the concept of the 'knowledge\ud
economy'. The thesis argues that:\ud
ri this concept, which originated in social and management theory, has been framed in\ud
terms of the Cartesian conception of the 'two worlds of knowledge': knowledge of\ud
natural and social structures and everyday knowledge;\ud
u these two worlds have been perpetuated in educational policy, for example, in\ud
curricula through a strong emphasis on 'knowledge' and 'skifis' and in pedagogy\ud
through the development of 'pedagogies of reflection'.\ud
Consequently, educational policy has:\ud
u missed that the knowledge economy is making the interdependence between the\ud
two worlds of knowledge more explicit in economic and cultural activity;\ud
u failed to appreciate that this development presupposes 'pedagogies' that support to\ud
overcome the two worlds of knowledge to respond to the challenges posed by the\ud
knowledge economy.\ud
The thesis argues that Cultural-Historical Activity Theory (hereafter CHAT) provides a\ud
conceptual framework for going beyond the two worlds of knowledge in social and\ud
management theory as well as in educational research, policy and practice. It explores\ud
this claim by arguing that Vygotsky's concept of mediation and its extension and\ud
elaboration by a number of post-Vygotskians and neo-Hegelians introduces a way of\ud
conceiving the relation between activity, thought, language and mind which does not\ud
split mind from world. It then uses this reformulation of the conceptual of mediation as\ud
a foundation to formulate a pedagogy of mediated activity which it maintains is the\ud
basis of overcoming the two worlds of knowledge and responding to the challenge\ud
posed by the knowledge economy"

255,Children's expressions of randomness : constructing probabilistic ideas in an open computer game,"The research literature on children's understanding of randomness has developed\ud
considerably in recent decades, notably due to the key contributions of researchers such as\ud
Piaget and Inhelder (1975) and Tversky and Kahneman (1983). Yet the research has paid\ud
rather scant attention to the tools that people have available for expressing ideas about\ud
randomness, fairness and more generally, probability. In contrast, work within the\ud
paradigm of 'constructionism' makes the explicit claim that by using tools that are\ud
specially designed for expressing concepts of randomness and chance, people may be\ud
better able to express ideas that can seldom be predicted by cognitive analysis based on,\ud
say, misconceptions or thinking stages that fail to take sufficient account of too] mediation.\ud
This study investigated the nature of young children's expressions of random events.\ud
Specifically the aims of the study were:\ud
E iteratively to design and evaluate a tool-based game to afford children between the\ud
ages of 5 1/2and 8 opportunities to express and develop probabilistic ideas; and\ud
m to describe and analyse how the tool-based game mediated the children's\ud
expressions of chance events.\ud
An open computer game was designed for children to express understandings of\ud
randomnessa s formal conjectures, so that they were able to examine the consequenceso f\ud
their understandings. The game was designed simultaneously to afford children the\ud
opportunity to explore and express their intuitions and ideas, and to give the researcher the\ud
opportunity to study how probabilistic ideas evolved during the activity.\ud
The study was organised in two main phases. The first, iterative design phase, compared\ud
two cycles of design and experiments with children as they played with and reconstructed\ud
the game. The second phase consisted of the learning investigation phase, which describes\ud
in detail the expressed ideas of children in using the game. This thesis shows how a visible\ud
and 'continuous' medium, i. e. one in which the sample space is represented by a spatial\ud
and dynamic metaphor, can enhance young children's expressions of randomness. The\ud
findings identify children's initial meanings for expressing stochastic phenomena and\ud
describe how the computer tool-based game helped to shift children's attempts to\ud
understand randomness from looking for ways to control random behaviour, towards\ud
looking for ways to control events. This was significant, since the study analyses howchildren constructed their own ideas for fairness and in particular, how they constructed\ud
both symmetrical and asymmetrical spatial arrangements for it. In general, it is conjectured\ud
that the structure of the game, and in particular, the linkage between its components,\ud
assisted children in developing associated mental structures that developed their\ud
understandings of chance. Finally, evidence is presented that the children constructed a set\ud
of 'situated abstractions' for ideas such as 'distribution' and the 'law of large numbers'"

267,A study of cultural content in the British ELT GLobal Coursebook : a cultural studies approach,"This thesis investigates cultural content in a sample of British ELT global\ud
coursebooks published over the past three decades from a cultural studies perspective.\ud
Using a constructionist epistemology, the study aims to identify the nature of cultural\ud
content, to account for the form it takes and to examine what a group of Barcelonabased\ud
teachers think about such content and the role of culture in ELT. The research\ud
design is based on a modified version of the `circuit of culture' proposed by Du Gay,\ud
Hall et al. (1997) for the investigation of the construction of meanings associated with\ud
cultural artefacts.\ud
A descriptive framework, combining elements of content analysis and social semiotics,\ud
is applied to four best-selling coursebooks. Their `representational repertoires' are\ud
shown to be typified by a pervasive `native speakerism', and the deployment of\ud
discourses of feminism, multiculturalism, individualism and consumerism, alongside\ud
the ongoing globalizing of content. This content is partly explained by referring to\ud
publishers' guidelines and interviews with publishers, in which a discourse analysis\ud
approach is used. However, it is only by turning to the literatures on visual\ud
communication, consumerism and the concept of promotional culture that a fuller\ud
explanation can be provided.\ud
What emerges is a picture of a carefully constructed artefact, only some of whose\ud
meanings resonate with those of the teachers. Interviews reveal that they construe\ud
their practice in terms of teaching English as an international language for\ud
predominantly lingua franca purposes. Broad approval for the representational\ud
practices associated with gender and race does not extend to the pervasive `native\ud
speakerism' or content which is seen as irrelevant to the context of instruction. The\ud
thesis suggests that the form cultural content takes is best decided by locals for whom\ud
English may have a range of meanings other than those determined for them by\ud
British ELT publishers"

273,An investigation of the Movimento da Escola Moderna (MEM) pedagogy and its contribultion to learning to learn in Portuguese pre-schools,"This study identifies how the Movimento da Escola Moderna model for pre-school\ud
education works in practice, and how it has supported (or constrained) effective learning\ud
processes associated with 'learning to learn'.\ud
The conceptual framework combines socio-cultural theories of learning with literature\ud
on learning to learn and the role of interactions in teaching-learning processes to\ud
identify effective learning processes in the early years.\ud
Adopting an interpretative approach to research, the study involves an in depth casestudy\ud
approach with ethnographic elements. Two classrooms, purposefully selected,\ud
provide detailed illustrative cases of the MEM pedagogy. Data included observations\ud
(participant observations and video recording), interviews (adults and children), and\ud
documents. The analysis combined a theoretically driven framework with grounded\ud
analysis.\ud
This research showed that relationships between the MEM model, its practice and the\ud
children's participation in processes that promote 'learning to learn', are not\ud
straightforward. Both classrooms provided 'communities of learning' where children\ud
were encouraged to self-regulate their learning and engage in collaborative activities,\ud
transforming their identity from 'child' to 'leamer', and their leading activity from\ud
'playing with others' to 'learning with others' . It was found that the structural and\ud
dynamic quality of day-to-day practices sometimes had contradictory effects, which led\ud
to the identification of some conditions required to guarantee such change for all the\ud
children including the youngest and those less participative.\ud
The implications for further development of the MEM model and teachers' practices are\ud
discussed. These findings contribute to understand the role of pedagogy in\ud
mediating, from an early age, the development of a life-long learner.\u"
274,The writing on the wall : (accessing) children's meanings of land in the Outer Hebrides at the beginning of the 21st century,"In 1990 the United Nations Convention of the rights of the child recognised children as\ud
a minority group, social actors with a right to be heard. In parallel, interest in children's\ud
voices increased within academia. This research adds to current work within children's\ud
geographies, through an exploratory case study in the Outer Hebrides, Scotland, with a\ud
group of participants (6 to 12 years old). Based on a series of workshops, participants\ud
were invited to become artists-in-residence on the theme of land within their everyday\ud
lives.\ud
This thesis set two substantive questions: what are participants' meanings of land in the\ud
Outer Hebrides and how do these meanings relate to current theories around human's\ud
relationship with land? Findings showed that meanings of land were not uniform though\ud
meanings embodied movement through daily lives, creating a sense of self and\ud
'belonging' Participants were not controlled excessively by adult narratives of strangerdanger\ud
but by the physical topography, which mirrored many inhabitants' experiences.\ud
Participant's meanings of land are understood through two theories of human's\ud
relationship with land. First, Ingold's phenomenological concept of landscape as\ud
dwelling, recognising the influence of past generations (walking the land tending sheep),\ud
and more 'modem' activities, (watching soap operas at home). Second, Massey's concept\ud
of progressive sense of place, recognising the influence of wider social forces and\ud
explains an everyday land inhabited by a Bengal tiger.\ud
This research has a number of original contributions. First, this research increases\ud
knowledge on an under researched part of the Sconish Islands around inhabitants\ud
everyday lives and land. Second, a third, and methodological, research question explored\ud
the debate: is doing research with children different from doing research with adults?\ud
Here I argue that pre-labelling any participants by social identities contradicts the\ud
bonom-up approach of participatory methodologies, as identities are multiple and are\ud
something we 'do' not 'have'. This final issues aims to address the narrow readership\ud
within children's geographies and persuade all researchers to no longer view the 'child' as\ud
'other' to the adult and outside mainstream social research"

281,A study of stepfathering : involvement and meaning making in contemporary stepfamilies,"Stepfamilies are complex and diverse. Until recently there has been little research that has explored stepfathers' perspectives concerning their involvement in stepfamilies. A number of fatherhood researchers have suggested similarities between stepfathers and biological fathers in the provision of nurture and care for stepchildren. This exploratory study was designed to develop knowledge and understanding of stepfathers' involvement in the care of stepchildren, from their own perspectives. In-depth interviews were carried out with thirty-five stepfathers. The aim was to identify what being a stepfather means to men, by examining the ways in which they make commitments to, take responsibilities for, and are sensitive to their stepchildren. Stepfathers' involvement in stepfamilies, in terms of their care for and about stepchildren, was examined across a range of activities in different types of stepfamilies. The study also examined the resources stepfathers drew upon in their stepfathering and the constraints they faced, and how the men shaped their own identities in stepfamilies. The findings suggest three models of stepfathering. The first group expressed the least clarity about their roles, had little involvement in stepfamilies. The second group demonstrated a traditionally masculinist approach to parenting. They were 'moderately involved' in stepfamilies, with clearly defined roles for mothers, stepfathers, and non-resident fathers. Men in the third group demonstrated a pluralistic imagery of family life, a less gendered interpretation of fathering, and a more equitably gendered pattern of couple relations. They were actively involved in sharing the care for stepchildren with the children's mothers and non-resident fathers. They made commitments, negotiated responsibilities, were sensitive to stepchildren's needs, and had made changes to their traditional work-oriented, primary-earner role, in order to do more care for the next generation"

283,Students' ideas about different representations of the past : South Korean adolescents interpret historical film,"This thesis explores the ways in which secondary school students interpret different\ud
representations of the past as portrayed in the film. It focuses on the question of how they set\ud
the film director's view within a sociocultural context, and how they conceptualise what\ud
constitutes acceptable historical knowledge. Ninety-six secondary school students in South\ud
Korea viewed two sets of historical films that vary in terms of authorship, period, and genre.\ud
The viewings were followed by semi-structured interviews, which aimed to investigate a\ud
range of students' approaches to different representations produced at a given place and time.\ud
This thesis argues that acknowledging the structuring of historical knowledge as a part of\ud
cultural practice enabled students to make a shift in their picture of the past: from the idea of\ud
the past as being reproduced to that of the past as being organised and reconstructed. A range\ud
of ideas about historical knowledge, from a direct report of the event through an\ud
idiosyncratic interpretation of a literary past to systematic mediation of historical reality, was\ud
identified.\ud
Through analysis of students' approaches to revision of the past, this thesis also discusses the\ud
relationship between ideas about the role of perspective in history and ideas about the\ud
reconfiguration of the past for the present. Students tended to assume that more committed\ud
perspectives were likely to subject historical representations to greater revision of history.\ud
Students' ideas about changing representations of the past reflected their presuppositions\ud
about change of viewpoints in historical enquiry, mainly either in an empirical or cultural\ud
sense rather than in a methodological sense.\ud
Given students' tendency to conceive historical representations as being subject to\ud
perspective mainly fuelled by present interests, it is crucial to provide an opportunity for\ud
them to frame an historical account as an answer to a particular question, attributing a\ud
positive role to perspectival views of the past"
284,A Comparative study of English and Egyptian word associations and their implications for the teaching of English to Egyptian learners,"Revival of interest in word associations has\ud
taken a new shape. It has been realized that word\ud
associations can be a reliable technique for the comparative\ud
study of cultures. Word associations can explore\ud
the contents of human minds without being expressed in\ud
the full discursive structure of language. They are\ud
capable of yielding significant information about the\ud
attitudes, beliefs, and cognitive structures of cultures.\ud
This information may be of considerable pedagogic\ud
importance in foreign-language teaching. A foreign\ud
language should be taught in its native cultural context.\ud
Hence, foreign learners have to learn about this cultural\ud
context. Word associations can help the FL teacher in\ud
this respect through introducing, to the learners, this\ud
information about the attitudes, beliefs, and cognitive\ud
structure of the culture of the target language.\ud
A comparative study of English and Egyptian\ud

294,Institutional Differences in 16-19 GCE Advanced Level Education in England,"The primary focus of this thesis is on whether there are any significant differences in the experiences of young people aged 16-19 studying GCE Advanced Level which result from whether they attend a school sixth form, sixth form college or tertiary college in England. The study uses quantitative and qualitative data to consider whether there are differences in examination achievement by young people or in their perception of their wider educational experience. The study also uses qualitative data on the views of senior staff in those institutions and of policy makers. The study is original in three respects: young people in the three different types of institution completed an identical questionnaire, and were interviewed on the same basis; an original analysis of value-added data for tertiary colleges, separated from general further education colleges; and the research makes use of the researcher’s extensive access to, and involvement in, contemporaneous 14-19 policy development. The study shows that educational policy development in England is undertaken within a complex educational, economic and political environment, and provides an overview of 16-19 provision and policy in the home nations and some European countries, together with a consideration of tripartism in education in England – both its historical origins and development, and its likely future direction. The main conclusion from the study is that there is little difference in the value-added to the examination performance of young people resulting from the type of institution they attend. The study also suggests that the young people, regardless of the institution they attend, are generally positive about their experience; however, students in school sixth forms are less positive about a number of aspects of that experience. As the research progressed, there were strengthening Ministerial steers towards tertiary tripartism – a strengthening of the divisions between academic, vocational and occupational learning"
295,Children's naming and word-finding difficulties: descriptions and explanations,"Purpose: There are a substantial minority of children for whom lexical retrieval problems impede the normal pattern of language development and use. These problems include accurately producing the correct word even when the word?s meaning is understood; such children are often referred to as having word-finding difficulties (WFDs). This review examines the nature of naming and lexical retrieval difficulties in these and other groups of children. Method: A review of the relevant literature on lexical access difficulties in children with word finding difficulties was conducted. Studies were examined in the terms of population parameters and comparison groups included in the study. Results and Conclusions: Most discussions of the cognitive processes causing lexical retrieval difficulties have referred to semantics, phonology and processing speed. It is argued that our understanding of these topics will be further advanced by the use of appropriate methodology to test developmental models that both identify the processes in successfully performing different lexical retrieval tasks and more precisely locating the difficulties experienced by children with such tasks"

At a cognitive level, this population display poor visuo-spatial cognition when compared to verbal ability. Within the visuo-spatial domain, it is now accepted that individuals with WS are able to perceive both local and global aspects of an image, albeit at a low level. The present study examines the manner in which local elements are grouped into a global whole in WS. Fifteen individuals with WS and 15 typically developing controls, matched for non-verbal ability, were presented with a matrix of local elements and asked whether these elements were perceptually grouped horizontally or vertically. The WS group were at the same level as the control group when grouping by luminance, closure, and alignment. However, their ability to group by shape, orientation and proximity was significantly poorer than controls. This unusual profile of grouping abilities in WS suggests that these individuals do not form a global percept in a typical manner"
299,A modification of the convective constraint release mechanism in the molecular stress function model giving enhanced vortex growth,"The molecular stress function model with convective constraint release (MSF with CCR) constitutive model [J. Rheol. 45 (2001), 1387] is capable of fitting all viscometric data for IUPAC LDPE, with only two adjustable parameters (with difference found only on reported ¿steady-state¿ elongational viscosities). The full MSF with CCR model is implemented in a backwards particle-tracking implementation, using an adaptive method for the computation of relative stretch that reduces simulation time many-fold, with insignificant loss of accuracy. The model is shown to give improved results over earlier versions of the MSF (without CCR) when compared to well-known experimental data from White and Kondo [J. non-Newt. Fluid Mech., 3 (1977), 41]; but still to under-predict contraction flow opening angles. The discrepancy is traced to the interaction between the rotational dissipative function and the large stretch levels caused by the contraction flow. A modified combination of dissipative functions in the constraint release mechanism is proposed, which aims to reduce this interaction to allow greater strain hardening in a mixed flow. The modified constraint release mechanism is shown to fit viscometric rheological data equally well, but to give opening angles in the complex contraction flow that are much closer to the experimental data from White and Kondo. It is shown (we believe for the first time) that a constitutive model demonstrates an accurate fit to all planar elongational, uniaxial elongational and shear viscometric data, with a simultaneous agreement with this well-known experimental opening angle data. The sensitivity of results to inaccuracies caused by representing the components of the deformation gradient tensor to finite precision is examined; results are found to be insensitive to even large reductions in the precision used for the representation of components. It is shown that two models that give identical response in elongational flow, and a very similar fit to available shear data, give significantly different results in flows containing a mix of deformation modes. The implication for constitutive models is that evaluation against mixed deformation mode flow data is desirable in addition to evaluation against viscometric measurements"
300,"Dermatological remedies in the traditional pharmacopoeia of Vulture-Alto Bradano, inland southern Italy","Dermatological remedies make up at least one-third of the traditional pharmacopoeia in southern Italy. The identification of folk remedies for the skin is important both for the preservation of traditional medical knowledge and in the search for novel antimicrobial agents in the treatment of skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI). Our goal is to document traditional remedies from botanical, animal, mineral and industrial sources for the topical treatment of skin ailments. In addition to SSTI remedies for humans, we also discuss certain ethnoveterinary applications.
Field research was conducted in ten communities in the Vulture-Alto Bradano area of the Basilicata province, southern Italy. We randomly sampled 112 interviewees, stratified by age and gender. After obtaining prior informed consent, we collected data through semi-structured interviews, participant-observation, and small focus groups techniques. Voucher specimens of all cited botanic species were deposited at FTG and HLUC herbaria located in the US and Italy.
We report the preparation and topical application of 116 remedies derived from 38 plant species. Remedies are used to treat laceration, burn wound, wart, inflammation, rash, dental abscess, furuncle, dermatitis, and other conditions. The pharmacopoeia also includes 49 animal remedies derived from sources such as pigs, slugs, and humans. Ethnoveterinary medicine, which incorporates both animal and plant derived remedies, is addressed. We also examine the recent decline in knowledge regarding the dermatological pharmacopoeia.
The traditional dermatological pharmacopoeia of Vulture-Alto Bradano is based on a dynamic folk medical construct of natural and spiritual illness and healing. Remedies are used to treat more than 45 skin and soft tissue conditions of both humans and animals. Of the total 165 remedies reported, 110 have never before been published in the mainland southern Italian ethnomedical literature"
301,Peak response of non-linear oscillators under stationary white noise,"The use of the Advanced Censored Closure (ACC) technique, recently proposed by the authors for
predicting the peak response of linear structures vibrating under random processes, is extended to
the case of non-linear oscillators driven by stationary white noise. The proposed approach requires
the knowledge of mean upcrossing rate and spectral bandwidth of the response process, which in
this paper are estimated through the Stochastic Averaging method. Numerical applications to
oscillators with non-linear stiffness and damping are included, and the results are compared with
those given by Monte Carlo Simulation and by other approximate formulations available in the literature"
302,Aggregation and the Role of Trusted Third Parties in SME E-Business Engagement: A Regional Policy Issue,"YesIt is against the background of low engagement by SMEs in e-business that this paper seeks to highlight the potential importance of aggregation and of the role of trusted third parties in facilitating higher levels of involvement. The paper is based on an ongoing SME e-business research programme and reports on some recent research on SMEs that were using high complexity e-business applications and explores the extent to which the research findings could address the core concern of low engagement. This qualitative case study based research includes analysis of data collected from 13 community intermediaries, acting as trusted third parties. It concludes that the role of community intermediaries appears to be central to the adoption of critical e-aggregation applications provided by service providers. For policymakers, this important role of critical e-aggregation applications in facilitating e-business engagement by SMEs has emerged as part of this research but there is limited evidence of policy initiatives that reflect this"
303,"Missing, Presumed Buried? Bone Diagenesis and the Under-Representation of Anglo-Saxon Children","YesSam Lucy (1994: 26) has stated that a `recognised feature of pre-Christian early medieval cemeteries in eastern England is the smaller number of younger burials recovered¿. Although taphonomic factors such as the increased rate of decay of the remains of children and shallow depth of burial have been suggested as possible explanations for this phenomenon, these have been disregarded in favour of cultural influences, with younger children thought to have been disposed of in a different way from adult remains (Lucy, 1994; Härke, 1997; Crawford, 1999). This paper will review the evidence concerning the treatment of the remains of children during the Anglo-Saxon period. It will then review the factors affecting bone preservation, with special reference to the bones of children, and attempt to assess to what extent the under-representation of children in Anglo-Saxon cemeteries can be attributed to bone preservation and soil type. It will show that hypotheses should not be formulated without full consideration of the taphonomy that may affect the completeness of the archaeological record"

305,Intelligent Learning Algorithms for Active Vibration Control,"YesThis correspondence presents an investigation into the
comparative performance of an active vibration control (AVC) system
using a number of intelligent learning algorithms. Recursive least square
(RLS), evolutionary genetic algorithms (GAs), general regression neural
network (GRNN), and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS)
algorithms are proposed to develop the mechanisms of an AVC system.
The controller is designed on the basis of optimal vibration suppression
using a plant model. A simulation platform of a flexible beam system
in transverse vibration using a finite difference method is considered to
demonstrate the capabilities of the AVC system using RLS, GAs, GRNN,
and ANFIS. The simulation model of the AVC system is implemented,
tested, and its performance is assessed for the system identification models
using the proposed algorithms. Finally, a comparative performance of the
algorithms in implementing the model of the AVC system is presented and
discussed through a set of experiments"
306,A Case Study of Scheduling Storage Tanks Using a Hybrid Genetic Algorithm,"YesThis paper proposes the application of a hybrid genetic
algorithm (GA) for scheduling storage tanks. The proposed
approach integrates GAs and heuristic rule-based techniques,
decomposing the complex mixed-integer optimization problem
into integer and real-number subproblems. The GA string considers
the integer problem and the heuristic approach solves the
real-number problems within the GA framework. The algorithm
is demonstrated for three test scenarios of a water treatment
facility at a port and has been found to be robust and to give a
significantly better schedule than those generated using a random
search and a heuristic-based approach"
307,"Managing culture at British Airways: hype, hope and reality","YesNearly twenty years after the publication of the (in)famous In Search of Excellence, the
notion of `cultural change¿ within organisations continues to excite attention. This is
readily understandable, since cultural interventions offer practitioners the hope of a
universal panacea to organisational ills and academics an explanatory framework that
enjoys the virtues of being both partially true and gloriously simple. Such a
combination is apparent in the way that many attempts to shape organisational culture
are presented to the public: as simple stories with happy endings.1 This article attempts
to rescue a fairy-tale. The story of British Airways is one of the most widely used
inspirational accounts of changing culture. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s it was
used to demonstrate the necessary compatibility of pleasure and profits2 in celebratory
accounts where culture change is presented as the only explanation for the
transformation that occurred. This corrective makes no attempt to deny the very
substantial changes that took place in BA. Rather, it sets these in context noting the
organisation¿s environment at the time of the transformation, the structural changes
that took place and observes the impact that such changes had over the long term.3¿"

310,Implementation of virtual manufacturing by a technology licensing company,NoThe paper considers the implementation of a virtual manufacturing system as an alternative to outward technology licensing in a high technology industrial sector. Brief theoretical definition and description of the two strategy options is provided to give background and context. This is followed by empirical material from a longitudinal case study of a company that has developed a virtual manufacturing system in addition to its pre-existing outward technology licensing business stream. A summary account of the company history and development is followed by description of the virtual manufacturing proposal. Analysis of this identified a number of competencies that would be required in order to succeed. The final part of the paper describes the company's response to this analysis and discusses early implementation of the virtual system. It is shown that implementation of the proposal has represented a positive response to the business challenges facing the company

336,Ethnic enclaves and employment in England and Wales,"This paper examines the effects of ethnic enclaves on the employment probability of ethnic minorities living in England and Wales. Controlling for the endogeneity of residential location we find that living in a high own ethnic concentration area has no systematic effect across all ethnic groups. However, once we disaggregate we find that for some ethnic groups (Indians) enclaves seem to have a positive and significant impact on their employment probability while for other groups (Caribbeans and African-Asians), enclaves have a negative and significant impact. These results are non-trivial and are in accordance with a set of theoretical views in this literature that argue that ethnic spatial concentration can have positive as well as negative effects. The perceived disadvantages of ethnic enclaves are not omnipresent. What seem to be driving this are the differences in the quality of ethnic enclaves where Indian enclaves by being more dynamic in terms of self-employment create more jobs for others within the enclave"
337,Urban Effects on Participation and Wages: Are there Gender Differences,"This paper estimates participation and wage equations using panel data from the United Kingdom to explore gender differences in urban wage and participation premiums. The results suggest a small but economically significant urban participation premium for women but none for men. Results from the wage estimations suggest that after controlling for sample selectivity, observed and unobserved heterogeneity, the urban premium is larger for women. This wage premium is also larger for married or cohabiting women relative to others. There is also evidence of higher urban returns to experience for men and lower urban wage depreciation for both men and women"
338,Who are the moonlighters and why they moonlight: Evidence for rural communities,"This paper examines the incidence of and reasons for moonlighting in the context of rural communities where multiple-job holding is viewed as an important means of promoting sustainability of these communities. Drawing upon a unique dataset of a relatively homogeneous population living in an isolated area on the west coast of Scotland, where employment opportunities are limited, dual-job holding is investigated within the fisheries and aquaculture industries. Evidence is found that those who moonlight do not do so primarily for financial reasons, and that educational attainment has a positive impact on the incidence of dual-job holding.The data used in this study has been collected for the purposes of the project “Aquaculture and Coastal Economic and Social Sustainability”, financed by the EU (project no. Q5RS-2000-31151)"
339,Insertion Heuristics for Central Cycle Problems,"A central cycle problem requires a cycle that is
reasonably short and keeps a the maximum distance
from any node not on the cycle to its nearest
node on the cycle reasonably low. The objective
may be to minimise maximumdistance or cycle
length and the solution may have further constraints.
Most classes of central cycle problems
are NP-hard. This paper investigates insertion
heuristics for central cycle problems, drawing on
insertion heuristics for p-centres [7] and travelling
salesman tours [21]. It shows that a modified
farthest insertion heuristic has reasonable worstcase
bounds for a particular class of problem.
It then compares the performance of two farthest
insertion heuristics against each other and
against bounds (where available) obtained by integer
programming on a range of problems from
TSPLIB [20]. It shows that a simple farthest insertion
heuristic is fast, performs well in practice
and so is likely to be useful for a general problems
or as the basis for more complex heuristics
for specific problems"

341,Community Hospitals - the place of local service provision in a modernising NHS : an integrative thematic literature review,"Background: Recent developments within the United Kingdom's (UK) health care system have re-awakened interest in community hospitals (CHs) and their role in the provision of health care. This integrative literature review sought to identify and assess the current evidence base for CHs. Methods: A range of electronic reference databases were searched from January 1984 to either December 2004 or February 2005: Medline, Embase, Web of Knowledge, BNI, CINAHL, HMIC, ASSIA, PsychInfo, SIGLE, Dissertation Abstracts, Cochrane Library, Kings Fund website, using both keywords and text words. Thematic analysis identified recurrent themes across the literature; narrative analyses were written for each theme, identifying unifying concepts and discrepant issues. Results: The search strategy identified over 16,000 international references. We included papers of any study design focussing on hospitals in which care was led principally by general practitioners or nurses. Papers from developing countries were excluded. A review of titles revealed 641 potentially relevant references; abstract appraisal identified 161 references for review. During data extraction, a further 48 papers were excluded, leaving 113 papers in the final review. The most common methodological approaches were cross-sectional/descriptive studies, commentaries and expert opinion. There were few experimental studies, systematic reviews, economic studies or studies that reported on longer-term outcomes. The key themes identified were origin and location of CHs; their place in the continuum of care; services provided; effectiveness, efficiency and equity of CHs; and views of patients and staff. In general, there was a lack of robust evidence for the role of CHs, which is partly due to the ad hoc nature of their development and lack of clear strategic vision for their future. Evidence for the effectiveness and efficiency of the services provided was limited. Most people admitted to CHs appeared to be older, suggesting that admittance to CHs was age-related rather than condition-related. Conclusion: Overall the literature surveyed was long on opinion and short of robust studies on CHs. While lack of evidence on CHs does not imply lack of effect, there is an urgent need to develop a research agenda that addresses the key issues of health care delivery in the CH setting.The Scottish School of Primary Car"

343,Earnings Aspirations and Job Satisfaction: The Affective and Cognitive Impact of Earnings Comparisons,"Theories of interdependent preferences predicts that the effect of peer earnings on individual well-being is either negative, the “relative deprivation”, or positive the “cognitive effect”. The evidence so far has attributed the dominance of each of the above effects on the country’s economic and political environment. This study claims that relative earnings can affect job satisfaction in two opposite ways, through the affective, “relative deprivation”, and the cognitive channel. The dominance of each effect depends on the individual-specific financial situation rather than the country’s environment. Utilising a longitudinal dataset for British employees, the results of this study show that the cognitive informational effect of “peer earnings” dominates social comparisons for those in financial distress. It further suggests job satisfaction is a relative concept"

In doing so, it attempts to take into account the endogenous nature of the job security – job satisfaction relationship after controlling for the various economic and personal characteristics. The results show that, workers in jobs with low likelihood of job termination derive higher utility from work compared to the workers in insecure jobs. This holds even after controlling for endogeneity by using both a conventional IV approach and a selection model. This appears to be the case for both men and women.European Commissio"

It focuses on the effects of the individual employment status on alternative indicators of demand for health care that constitutes a largely unexplored area. The evidence supports the existence of an employment status- demand for health care relationship although it varies with respect to the type of health care examined and the institutional and environmental settings of the countries utilised in the study
348,Do self-reported intentions predict clinicians behaviour: a systematic review.,"Background: Implementation research is the scientific study of methods to promote the systematic uptake of
clinical research findings into routine clinical practice. Several interventions have been shown to be effective in
changing health care professionals' behaviour, but heterogeneity within interventions, targeted behaviours, and
study settings make generalisation difficult. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the 'active ingredients' in
professional behaviour change strategies. Theories of human behaviour that feature an individual's ""intention"" to
do something as the most immediate predictor of their behaviour have proved to be useful in non-clinical
populations. As clinical practice is a form of human behaviour such theories may offer a basis for developing a
scientific rationale for the choice of intervention to use in the implementation of new practice. The aim of this
review was to explore the relationship between intention and behaviour in clinicians and how this compares to
the intention-behaviour relationship in studies of non-clinicians.
Methods: We searched: PsycINFO, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled
Trials, Science/Social science citation index, Current contents (social & behavioural med/clinical med), ISI
conference proceedings, and Index to Theses. The reference lists of all included papers were checked manually.
Studies were eligible for inclusion if they had: examined a clinical behaviour within a clinical context, included
measures of both intention and behaviour, measured behaviour after intention, and explored this relationship
quantitatively. All titles and abstracts retrieved by electronic searching were screened independently by two
reviewers, with disagreements resolved by discussion.
Discussion: Ten studies were found that examined the relationship between intention and clinical behaviours in
1623 health professionals. The proportion of variance in behaviour explained by intention was of a similar
magnitude to that found in the literature relating to non-health professionals. This was more consistently the case
for studies in which intention-behaviour correspondence was good and behaviour was self-reported. Though firm
conclusions are limited by a smaller literature, our findings are consistent with that of the non-health professional
literature. This review, viewed in the context of the larger populations of studies, provides encouragement for
the contention that there is a predictable relationship between the intentions of a health professional and their
subsequent behaviour. However, there remain significant methodological challenges"
349,The Subtour Centre Problem,"The subtour centre problem is the problem of finding a closed trail S of bounded length on a connected simple graph G that minimises the maximum distance from S to any vertex ofG. It is a central location problem related to the cycle centre and cycle median problems (Foulds et al., 2004; Labbé et al., 2005) and the covering tour problem (Current and Schilling, 1989). Two related heuristics and an integer linear programme are formulated for it. These are compared numerically using a range of problems derived from tsplib (Reinelt, 1995). The heuristics usually perform substantially better then the integer linear programme and there is some evidence that the simpler heuristics perform better on the less dense graphs that may be more typical of applications"
350,Understanding consumption within a residential care home : an interpretation of George’s everyday experiences of life and death,"We are witnessing perhaps the most important shift in the history of mankind – the rapid ageing of the earths population. This trend raises such issues as elderly care giving and living arrangements in old age. By virtue, the author suggests that managing service provision for elderly consumers within residential care homes is going to become an increasingly important issue as more consumers live longer and require residential care. Moreover, given the paucity of literature related to elderly consumers understandings of such institutions this research aims to illuminate and distil this issue. Based on existential-phenomenological hermeneutic interpretive methods the author reveals that elderly consumers actively consume life and death related experiences in order to create a meaningful existence within residential care homes"
351,"A Pragmatic Randomised, Controlled Trial of Intensive Care follow up programmes in improving Longer-term outcomes from critical illness : the PRACTICAL study","Background: A number of intensive care (ICU) patients experience significant problems with physical, psychological, and social functioning for some time after discharge from ICU. These problems have implications not just for patients, but impose a continuing financial burden for the National Health Service. To support recovery, a number of hospitals across the UK have developed Intensive Care follow-up clinics. However, there is a lack of evidence base to support these, and this study aims to test the hypothesis that intensive care follow up programmes are effective and cost-effective at improving physical and psychological quality of life in the year after intensive care discharge. Methods/Design: This is a multi-centre, pragmatic, randomised controlled trial. Patients (n = 270) will be recruited prior to hospital discharge from three intensive care units in the UK, and randomised to one of two groups. The control group will receive standard in-hospital follow-up and the intervention group will participate in an ICU follow-up programme with clinic appointments 2–3 and 9 months after ICU discharge. The primary outcome measure is Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL) 12 months after ICU discharge as measured by the Short Form-36. Secondary measures include: HRQoL at six months; Quality-adjusted life years using EQ-5D; posttraumatic psychopathology as measured by Davidson Trauma Scale; and anxiety and depression using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale at both six and twelve months after ICU discharge. Contacts with health services in the twelve months after ICU discharge will be measured as part of the economic analysis. Discussion: The provision of intensive care follow-up clinics within the UK has developed in an ad hoc manner, is inconsistent in both the number of hospitals offering such a service or in the type of service offered. This study provides the opportunity to evaluate such services both in terms of patient benefit and cost-effectiveness. The results of this study therefore will inform clinical practice and policy with regard to the appropriate development of such services aimed at improving outcomes after intensive care.This project is funded by the Chief Scientist Office of the Scottish Executive Health Department (project number CZH/4/351).Peer reviewedPublisher PD"
352,Applying psychological theory to evidence-based clinical practice : identifying factors predictive of managing upper respiratory tract infections without antibiotics,"Background: Psychological models can be used to understand and predict behaviour in a wide range of settings. However, they have not been consistently applied to health professional behaviours, and the contribution of differing theories is not clear. The aim of this study was to explore the usefulness of a range of psychological theories to predict health professional behaviour relating to management of upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) without antibiotics. Methods: Psychological measures were collected by postal questionnaire survey from a random sample of general practitioners (GPs) in Scotland. The outcome measures were clinical behaviour (using antibiotic prescription rates as a proxy indicator), behavioural simulation (scenario-based decisions to managing URTI with or without antibiotics) and behavioural intention (general intention to managing URTI without antibiotics). Explanatory variables were the constructs within the following theories: Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), Common Sense Self-Regulation Model (CS-SRM), Operant Learning Theory (OLT), Implementation Intention (II), Stage Model (SM), and knowledge (a non-theoretical construct). For each outcome measure, multiple regression analysis was used to examine the predictive value of each theoretical model individually. Following this 'theory level' analysis, a 'cross theory' analysis was conducted to investigate the combined predictive value of all significant individual constructs across theories. Results: All theories were tested, but only significant results are presented. When predicting behaviour, at the theory level, OLT explained 6% of the variance and, in a cross theory analysis, OLT 'evidence of habitual behaviour' also explained 6%. When predicting behavioural simulation, at the theory level, the proportion of variance explained was: TPB, 31%; SCT, 26%; II, 6%; OLT, 24%. GPs who reported having already decided to change their management to try to avoid the use of antibiotics made significantly fewer scenario-based decisions to prescribe. In the cross theory analysis, perceived behavioural control (TPB), evidence of habitual behaviour (OLT), CS-SRM cause (chance/bad luck), and intention entered the equation, together explaining 36% of the variance. When predicting intention, at the theory level, the proportion of variance explained was: TPB, 30%; SCT, 29%; CS-SRM 27%; OLT, 43%. GPs who reported that they had already decided to change their management to try to avoid the use of antibiotics had a significantly higher intention to manage URTIs without prescribing antibiotics. In the cross theory analysis, OLT evidence of habitual behaviour, TPB attitudes, risk perception, CS-SRM control by doctor, TPB perceived behavioural control and CS-SRM control by treatment entered the equation, together explaining 49% of the variance in intention. Cnclusion: The study provides evidence that psychological models can be useful in understanding and predicting clinical behaviour. Taking a theory-based approach enables the reation of a replicable methodology for identifying factors that predict clinical behaviour. Hwever, a number of conceptual and methodological challenges remain"

354,Protocol for stage 2 of the GaP study (genetic testing acceptability for Paget's disease of the bone) : a questionnaire study to investigate whether relatives of people with Paget's disease would accept genetic testing and preventative treatment if they were available,"Background: Paget's disease of bone (PDB) disrupts normal bone architecture and causes pain, deformity, deafness, osteoarthritis, and fractures. Genetic factors play a role in PDB and genetic tests are now conducted for research purposes. It is thus timely to investigate the potential for a clinical programme of genetic testing and preventative treatment for people who have a family history of PDB. This study examines the beliefs of relatives of people with PDB. It focuses particularly on illness and treatment representations as predictors of the acceptability and uptake of potential clinical programmes. Illness representations are examined using Leventhal's Common Sense Self-Regulation Model while cognitions about treatment behaviours (acceptance of testing and treatment uptake) are conceptualised within the Theory of Planned Behaviour. Methods/Design: A postal questionnaire of non-affected relatives of people with Paget's disease. The sample will include relatives of Paget's patients with a family history of Paget's disease and relatives of Paget's patients without a family history of Paget's disease. The questionnaire will explore whether a range of factors relate to acceptability of a programme of genetic testing and preventive treatment in relatives of Paget's disease sufferers. The questionnaire will include several measures: illness representations (as measured by the Brief Illness Perceptions Questionnaire); treatment representations (as measured by Theory of Planned Behaviour-based question items, informed by a prior interview elicitation study); descriptive and demographic details; and questions exploring family environment and beliefs of other important people. Data will also be collected from family members who have been diagnosed with Paget's disease to describe the disease presentation and its distribution within a family. Discussion: The answers to these measures will inform the feasibility of a programme of genetic testing and preventive treatment for individuals who are at a high risk of developing Paget's disease because they carry an appropriate genetic mutation. They will also contribute to theoretical and empirical approaches to predicting diagnostic and treatment behaviours from the combined theoretical models.We wish to acknowledge the Medical Research Council for financial support of this study.

355,Appropriate disclosure of a diagnosis of dementia : identifying the key behaviours of 'best practice',"Background: Despite growing evidence that many people with dementia want to know their diagnosis, there is wide variation in attitudes of professionals towards disclosure. The disclosure of the diagnosis of dementia is increasingly recognised as being a process rather than a one-off behaviour. However, the different behaviours that contribute to this process have not been comprehensively defined. No intervention studies to improve diagnostic disclosure in dementia have been reported to date. As part of a larger study to develop an intervention to promote appropriate disclosure, we sought to identify important disclosure behaviours and explore whether supplementing a literature review with other methods would result in the identification of new behaviours. Methods: To identify a comprehensive list of behaviours in disclosure we conducted a literature review, interviewed people with dementia and informal carers, and used a consensus process involving health and social care professionals. Content analysis of the full list of behaviours was carried out. Results: Interviews were conducted with four people with dementia and six informal carers. Eight health and social care professionals took part in the consensus panel. From the interviews, consensus panel and literature review 220 behaviours were elicited, with 109 behaviours over-lapping. The interviews and consensus panel elicited 27 behaviours supplementary to the review. Those from the interviews appeared to be self-evident but highlighted deficiencies in current practice and from the panel focused largely on balancing the needs of people with dementia and family members. Behaviours were grouped into eight categories: preparing for disclosure; integrating family members; exploring the patient's perspective; disclosing the diagnosis; responding to patient reactions; focusing on quality of life and well-being; planning for the future; and communicating effectively. Conclusion: This exercise has highlighted the complexity of the process of disclosing a diagnosis of dementia in an appropriate manner. It confirms that many of the behaviours identified in the literature (often based on professional opinion rather than empirical evidence) also resonate with people with dementia and informal carers. The presence of contradictory behaviours emphasises the need to tailor the process of disclosure to individual patients and carers. Our combined methods may be relevant to other efforts to identify and define complex clinical practices for further study.This project is funded by UK Medical Research Council, Grant reference number G0300999"
356,IMPLEmenting a clinical practice guideline for acute low back pain evidence-based manageMENT in general practice (IMPLEMENT) : cluster randomised controlled trial study protocol,"Background: Evidence generated from reliable research is not frequently implemented into clinical practice. Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines are a potential vehicle to achieve this. A recent systematic review of implementation strategies of guideline dissemination concluded that there was a lack of evidence regarding effective strategies to promote the uptake of guidelines. Recommendations from this review, and other studies, have suggested the use of interventions that are theoretically based because these may be more effective than those that are not. An evidencebased clinical practice guideline for the management of acute low back pain was recently developed in Australia. This provides an opportunity to develop and test a theory-based implementation intervention for a condition which is common, has a high burden, and for which there is an evidence-practice gap in the primary care setting. Aim: This study aims to test the effectiveness of a theory-based intervention for implementing a clinical practice guideline for acute low back pain in general practice in Victoria, Australia. Specifically, our primary objectives are to establish if the intervention is effective in reducing the percentage of patients who are referred for a plain x-ray, and improving mean level of disability for patients three months post-consultation. Methods/Design: This study protocol describes the details of a cluster randomised controlled trial. Ninety-two general practices (clusters), which include at least one consenting general practitioner, will be randomised to an intervention or control arm using restricted randomisation. Patients aged 18 years or older who visit a participating practitioner for acute non-specific low back pain of less than three months duration will be eligible for inclusion. An average of twenty-five patients per general practice will be recruited, providing a total of 2,300 patient participants. General practitioners in the control arm will receive access to the guideline using the existing dissemination strategy. Practitioners in the intervention arm will be invited to participate in facilitated face-to-face workshops that have been underpinned by behavioural theory.

357,Recovery from disability after stroke as a target for a behavioural intervention: Results of a randomised controlled trial,"Purpose: Disability following stroke is highly prevalent and is predicted by psychological variables such as control cognitions and emotions, in addition to clinical variables. This study evaluated the effectiveness of a workbook-based intervention, designed to change cognitions about control, in improving outcomes for patients and their carers. Method: At discharge, stroke patients were randomly allocated (with their carers) to a 5-week intervention (n = 103) or control (normal care: n = 100). The main outcome (at 6 months) was recovery from disability using a performance measure, with distress and satisfaction as additional outcomes. Results: The intervention group showed significantly better disability recovery, allowing for initial levels of disability, than those in the control group, F(1,201) = 5.61, p = 0.019. Groups did not differ in distress or satisfaction with care for patients or carers. The only psychological process variable improved by the intervention was Confidence in Recovery but this did not mediate the effects on recovery. Conclusions: A large proportion of intervention participants did not complete the workbook tasks. This was perhaps associated with the fairly low level of personal contact with workbook providers. The modest success of this intervention suggests that it may be possible to develop effective behavioural interventions to enhance recovery from disability in stroke patients"
358,How young people find out about their family history of Huntington's disease,"Family communication about adult-onset hereditary illness can be problematic, leaving some relatives
inadequately informed or ignorant of their risk. Although studies have explored the barriers and facilitators
in family communication about genetic risk, questions remain about when, what, how and indeed
whether to tell relatives. The process of disclosure is also dependent upon the way in which genetic
information is realized and understood by recipients, but research here is limited. Our paper explores
young people’s experiences of finding out about a family history of the hereditary disorder Huntington’s
disease (HD). In-depth interviews explored how and when young people found out, their reactions to
different communication styles and any impact on family relations. We recruited young people through
the North of Scotland regional genetics clinic and the Scottish Huntington’s Association (SHA). Thirtythree
young people (aged 9–28) were interviewed. A qualitative analysis was undertaken which revealed
four types of disclosure experiences: (1) having always been told, (2) gradually told, (3) HD was kept
a secret, or (4) HD as a new diagnosis. In particular, the timing and style of disclosure from relatives, and
one’s stage of awareness, were fundamental in structuring participants’ accounts. This article focuses on
questions of when, how and indeed whether to tell children, and sits within a broader set of research and
practice issues about what professionals and families (should) tell children about parental illness and
genetic risk.Wellcome Trust’s Programme in Biomedical Ethic"

360,"Does taking vitamin, mineral and fatty acid supplements prevent cognitive decline? A systematic review of randomized controlled trials","Background Observational studies have shown associations between nutritional status and cognition in later life but evidence from intervention studies is unclear. The present study systematically reviewed the evidence on the effect of nutrient supplementation on cognitive function in people aged ≥65 years.
Methods Databases including MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched up to 1 September 2006. Randomized controlled trials using at least one kind of vitamin, mineral or omega-3 fatty acid, evaluating standardized neuropsychological test(s), were included. There were no restrictions on participants' baseline nutritional status or cognitive function. Quality assessment and data abstraction were conducted by one author and checked by another.
Results Of 4229 articles retrieved, 22 trials (3442 participants) were identified. Many were small, short duration and of poor methodology. Only 16 out of 122 cognitive tests were significantly different between groups. A meta-analysis showed no significant effect of taking B vitamins or antioxidant vitamins on global cognitive function. There was insufficient evidence to evaluate the effect of omega-3 fatty acids on any cognitive domains.
Conclusion There was little evidence of a beneficial effect from taking B vitamins or antioxidant supplements on global cognitive function in later life. Larger-scale randomized controlled trials of longer duration in selected age groups are needed.Institute of Applied Health Science, University of Aberdeen;

362,"An inquiry into the theory, causes and consequences of monitoring indicators of health and safety at work","This paper engages in an interdisciplinary survey of the current state of knowledge related to the theory, determinants and consequences of occupational safety and health (OSH). First, it synthesizes the available theoretical frameworks used by economists and psychologists to understand the issues related to the optimal provision of OSH in the labour market. Second, it reviews the academic literature investigating the correlates of a comprehensive set of OSH indicators, which portray the state of OSH infrastructure (social security expenditure, prevention, regulations), inputs (chemical and physical agents, ergonomics, working time, violence) and outcomes (injuries, illnesses, absenteeism, job satisfaction) within workplaces. Third, it explores the implications of the lack of OSH in terms of the economic and social costs that are entailed. Finally, the survey identifies areas of future research interests and suggests priorities for policy initiatives that can improve the health and safety of workers"
363,Union Mediation and Adaptation to Reciprocal Loyalty Arrangements,"This study assesses the industrial relations application of the “loyalty-exit-voice” proposition. The loyalty concept is linked to reciprocal employer-employee arrangements and examined as a job attribute in a vignette questionnaire distributed to low and medium-skilled employees. The responses provided by employees in three European countries indicate that reciprocal loyalty arrangements, which involve the exchange of higher effort for job security, are one of the most desirable job attributes. This attribute exerts a higher impact on the job evaluations provided by unionised workers, compared to their non-union counterparts. This pattern is robust to a number of methodological considerations. It appears to be an outcome of adaptation to union mediated cooperation. Overall the evidence suggests that the loyalty-job evaluation profiles of unionised workers are receptive to repeated interaction and negative shocks, such as unemployment experience. This is not the case for the non-union workers. Finally, unionised workers appear to “voice” a lower job satisfaction, but exhibit low “exit” intentions, compared to the non-unionised labour.EPICURUS, a project supported by the European Commission through the 5th Framework Programme “Improving Human Potential” (contract number: HPSE-CT-2002-00143"
364,Unionism and peer-referencing,"This study assesses the “fair-wage-effort” hypothesis, by examining (a) the relationship between relative wage comparisons and job satisfaction and quitting intensions, and (b) the relative ranking of stated effort inducing-incentives, in a novel dataset of unionised and non-unionised European employees. By distinguishing between downward and upward-looking wage comparisons, it is shown that wage comparisons to similar workers exert an asymmetric impact on the job satisfaction of union workers, a pattern consistent with inequity-aversion and conformism to the reference point. Moreover, union workers evaluate peer observation and good industrial relations more highly than payment and other incentives. In contrast, non-union workers are found to be more status-seeking in their satisfaction responses and less dependent on their peers in their effort choices The results are robust to endogenous union membership, considerations of generic loss aversion and across different tenure profiles. They are supportive of the individual egalitarian bias of collective wage determination and self-enforcing effort norms.EPICURUS, a project supported by the European Commission through the 5th Framework Programme “Improving Human Potential” (contract number: HPSE-CT-2002-00143"
365,Poor and Sick : Estimating the relationship between Household Income and Health,"This study evaluates the effect of the individual‘s household income on their health at the later stages of working life. A structural equation model is utilised in order to derive a composite and continuous index of the latent health status from qualitative health status indicators. The endogenous relationship between health status and household income status is taken into account by using IV estimators. The findings reveal a significant effect of individual household income on health before and after endogeneity is taken into account and after a host of other factors which is known to influence health, including hereditary factors and the individual‘s locus of control. Importantly, it is also shown that the childhood socioeconomic position of the individual has long lasting effects on health as it appears to play a significant role in determining health during the later stages of working life.European Commission under the Fifth Framework Programme “Quality of Life and Management of Living Resources” (contract number: QLRT-2001-02292"

In Study 1, principal-axis factor analysis of participants’ responses to popular meaning measures identified five latent constructs underlying them, labelled purposeful life, principled life, valued life, exciting life, and accomplished life. These dimensions resonate with the meaning in life concept as= understood by Frankl (1963) and the panoply of subsequent theoretical definitions (e.g. Battista and Almond 1973). Study 2 used these results as a foundation for developing a psychometrically satisfactory self-report questionnaire of each of these aspects of meaning in life. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) validated a five-factor structure, with each factor loading on a common second-order factor. Study 3 provided evidence for this new measure’s convergent validity and economic property. The final Meaningful Life Measure is reported and provides comprehensive but differentiated measurement of the meaning in life construct"
423,An Arabidopsis flavonoid transporter is required for anther dehiscence and pollen development,"FLOWER FLAVONOID TRANSPORTER (FFT) encodes a multidrug and toxin efflux family transporter in Arabidopsis thaliana. FFT (AtDTX35) is highly transcribed in floral tissues, the transcript being localized to epidermal guard cells, including those of the anthers, stigma, siliques and nectaries. Mutant analysis demonstrates that the absence of FFT transcript affects flavonoid levels in the plant and that the altered flavonoid metabolism has wide-ranging consequences. Root growth, seed development and germination, and pollen development, release and viability are all affected. Spectrometry of mutant versus wild-type flowers shows altered levels of a glycosylated flavonol whereas anthocyanin seems unlikely to be the substrate as previously speculated. Thus, as well as adding FFT to the incompletely described flavonoid transport network, it is found that correct reproductive development in Arabidopsis is perturbed when this particular transporter is missing"
424,Tourism policy and destination marketing in developing countries: the chain of influence,"Tourism marketers including destination marketing organisations (DMOs) and international tour operators play a pivotal role in destination marketing, especially in creating destination images. These images, apparent in tourist brochures, are designed to influence tourist decision-making and behaviour. This paper proposes the concept of a “chain of influence” in destination marketing and image-making, suggesting that the content of marketing materials is influenced by the priorities of those who design these materials, e.g. tour operators and DMOs. A content analysis of 2,000 pictures from DMO and tour operator brochures revealed synergies and divergence between these marketers. The brochure content was then compared to the South African tourism policy, concluding that the dominant factor in the chain of influence in the South African context is in fact its organic image"
425,The production of environmental news: a study of source-media relations,"This study analyses the production of environmental news and focuses upon the neglected area of source-media relations. Through a combination of in-depth, semi-structured interviews and content analysis, the study explores relations between media practitioners and key news sources, such as environmental pressure groups, related interest groups, scientists and the Department of the Environment. It suggests that a major lacuna exists within the analysis of source-media relations. Researchers have, until recently, adopted a media-centric position and have rarely considered the perceptions of the sources themselves. This thesis, then, fills an important gap in the literature. It argues that through largely focusing upon the ways in which media make use of sources, the sociology of mass communications has ignored a fundamental aspect of news production.



The hypothesis that environmental pressure groups are becoming increasingly adept in their approaches towards the media was supported by the research findings. Many of the campaigning pressure groups that were formed in the 1970s have become established news sources and key definers of the political agenda. During the late 1980s many environmental pressure groups experienced greater access to television and the press. This thesis highlights a number of weaknesses with the structuralist model of source-dependency which maintains that official sources such as government or the courts, co=and privileged access to the media by virtue of their representative status, institutional standing, or their claims to expert knowledge. It suggests that a new model of source-media relations needs to be developed.



While official sources tend to gam greater access to the media than non-official sources such as pressure groups, the evidence suggests that this observation needs to be qualified in a number of respects. First, this study indicates that it fails to take into account inequalities of access among 'accredited sources'. Second, it neglects the role of the media as definers in the agenda-setting process. Third, the structuralist model fails to analyse the varying degrees with which media practitioners judge the claims of 'primary definers'. The study indicates that journalists and broadcasters tend to view Friends of the Earth as more credible than Greenpeace. Finally, this thesis indicates that evidence about patterns of source-dependence deduced from content analysis or journalistic evidence needs to be supplemented by interviews with the sources themselves"
426,Farmers’ ethno-ecological knowledge of vegetable pests and pesticidal plant use in Malawi and Zambia,"While pests are a major constraint in vegetable production in many parts of Southern Africa, little is known about farmers’ knowledge and management practices. A survey was conducted among 168 and 91 vegetable farmers in Northern Malawi and Eastern Zambia, respectively, to evaluate their knowledge, attitudes and traditional management practices in tomato and crucifers (brassica). All respondents in Malawi and Zambia reported pest damage on tomato and crucifers, and 75% had used synthetic pesticides. The use of pesticidal plants, cultural practices and resistant varieties constituted a smaller portion of the pest control options in both crucifers and tomato. Over 70% of the  respondents were aware of pesticidal plants, and more female (75%) than male (55%) respondents reported using them. While over 20 different plant species were mentioned by respondents, Tephrosia vogelii accounted for 61 and 53% of the pesticidal species known to respondents in Malawi and Zambia, respectively. Farmers with small landholdings were more inclined to use pesticidal plants than those with medium and large landholding highlighting the importance of this management alternative for poor farmers. Most respondents were willing to cultivate pesticidal plants, which indicate that farmers understand the potential value of these plants in pest management"
427,Private sector norms and public service practices: employment relations in the civil service and the national health service,"This submission for a PhD by published work looks at employment relations in the Civil Service and the National Health Service( NHS) over the last decade and in particular at management/union relations, pay determination and equal opportunities. The focus of research over this period was the extent to which private sector norms are advocated by the State impacted on public sector practices:



a) in the Civil Service compared to the NHS

b) in employing bodies within the Civil Service(ie executive agencies and employing bodies within the NHS (ie NHS trusts). The submission is in three parts. 



First, the distinctions between the private and public sectors are discussed along with the change agenda pursued by successive governments since 1979 to make the public sector more like the private sector. Second, four key debates are rehearsed: whether the state as employer is no longer a 'model' employer, whether there has been trade union renewal; whether the public sector ethos has been undermined; and whether the accession of the Labour government in 1997 was a watershed in respect of public sector employment relations. Third, the author's contributions to these debates are demonstrated"
428,The corporate governance structure and corporate performance: empirical studies of China's listed real estate companies,"This study examines the effectiveness of the corporate governance mechanisms and their impact on corporate performance, using the data of one industry sector-China's listed real estate companies. The studies include four parts: (l). the ownership structure, (2). the board structure; (3). the manager compensation and (4). the agency costs measured by asset utilization efficiency and manager discretionary expenses. 



The empirical studies cover three years (2000 to 2002). Here I classify the listed real estate companies into the subgroups of state owned enterprises (SOEs), privately owned companies (POEs), SOEs dominated by state shares and state legal person shares for analysis. The conclusions are first, in the real estate industry of China where the market is not fully open and transparent; the land resource is controlled by the government and is transferred by the negotiation or agreement between related parties, rather than the open market price and the government has strong influence on the performance of the listed real estate companies. Although the ownership structure is diversified in the real estate industries and the POEs take part in the property market development with the SOEs, the ownership concentration is positively associated with the firm performance. The companies with highly concentrated ownership structure are state owned companies (SOEs), especially the state shares dominated SOEs. The state shares are positively associated with firm performance, indicating the government influence on the real estate industry. This study does not support the suggestion that SOEs are more inefficient and legal person shares outperform the state shares. The study also shows that under the concentrated ownership structure, the dilution of the controlling power among more than one controlling shareholder would reduce the agency cost and improve the firm performance. The second conclusion is that the board size is positively associated with firm performance, but the relationship is non-linear. The board with an appropriate portion of independent directors may improve the effectiveness of corporate governance. Board size is decided by the ownership structure and the adjustment of the ownership structure, e.g. increasing the number of shares owned by other large shareholders will change the board size and improve the monitoring function of the board. The third conclusion is that the agency costs rooted in the separation of ownership and management are related with ownership structure. The largest shareholder is significant in improving the assets utilization efficiency but not significant in reducing manager discretionary expense. The presence of the other blockholders would reduce the agency costs. The agency costs POEs are higher than that in SOEs, indicating that the owner/manager in POEs who owns less than 100% of the company stake is likely to extract benefits from the abuse of the controlling right. The fourth conclusion is that the manager's compensation of the China's listed real estate companies includes three elements, i.e. a basic salary, a position allowance and a bonus; they are all paid in cash. The managers own tiny or no equity stake of the company. Stock option is not adopted in China's listed real estate companies. Manager's compensation is not associated with the firm's performance, but is associated with firm size and the turnovers of chairmen and top managers.



The study also discusses the two fundamental issues that the corporate governance reform of China's listed companies are facing. One is the ambiguity of property rights in SOEs and another one is the inefficient managerial incentive system and the two factors are interlinked. The ambiguous property rights in SOEs have resulted in the companies being controlled by insiders in reality. The highly concentrated ownership structure has led to the board of directors being dominated by insiders-directors from the controlling shareholder and executive directors and the illiquidity of majority of shares on stock market makes the market as external governance factor ineffective. I also discuss the factors deterring the wide adoption of managerial stock option on the Chinese stock market"
429,Shop scheduling with availability constraints,"Scheduling Theory studies planning and timetabling of various industrial and human activities and, therefore, is of constant scientific interest.  Being a branch of Operational Research, Theory of Scheduling mostly deals with problems of practical interest which can be easily (from a mathematical point of view) solved by full enumeration and at the same time usually require enormous time to be solved optimally.  Therefore, one attempts to develop algorithms for finding optimal or near optimal solutions of the problems under consideration in reasonable time.  If the output of an algorithm is not always an optimal solution then the worst-case analysis of this algorithm is undertaken in order to estimate either a relative error or an absolute error that holds for any given instance of the problem.



Scheduling problems which are usually considered in the literature assume that the processing facilities are constantly available throughout the planning period.  However, in practice, the processing facility, e.g. a machine, a labour, etc. can become non-available due to various reasons, e.g. breakdowns, lunch breaks, holidays, maintenance work, etc.  All these facts stimulate research in the area of scheduling with non-availability constraints.  This branch of Scheduling Theory has recently received a lot of attention and a considerable number of research papers have been published.  This thesis is fully dedicated to scheduling with non-availability constraints under various assumptions on the structure of the processing system and on the types of non-availability intervals"
430,The development of self-injury as a multi-functional behaviour,"In order to advance our understanding of self-injury this longitudinal study investigated the experiences of 25 adults who had used or were using self-injury. This was achieved by obtaining verbal narrative accounts of their experiences of using self-injury from its onset during childhood or early adolescence, throughout adolescence and into adulthood. These verbatim accounts formed a corpus of data which was analysed using a grounded theory method. This process established seven robust categories associated with the use of self-injury consisting of behavioural, cognitive, emotional, social, occupational, communication and physiological experiences. By thoroughly examining these categories the development of self-injury as a versatile multi-functional behaviour emerged which was governed by the individuals‟ needs. Evidence for these multiple uses stemmed from the similarities that developed in the individuals‟ use of self-injury over time. Highlighting these multiple functions it was established that improved social, communication and occupational conditions were crucial aspects in the participants‟ reduction in using self-injury. The contribution this research has made towards developing our understanding of self-injury was addressed, particularly in relation to its use by the non-clinically defined members of the general public who took part, and in the context of advancing relevant nursing research and practice. Several critical aspects of the methodology were identified, in particular the restrictive generalisation of the findings to others who self-injure, and the use of retrospective accounts were discussed and directives were outlined to improve these aspects in future research. Proposals were made for further research to clarify and investigate the multiple functions of self-injury and to increase our understanding of the continuing use of covert self-injury during adulthood. Additionally, the relevance of the findings to nursing practice, principally in relation to adequately assessing the use of self-injury was discussed"
431,The innovative practitioner: reconceptualising the special needs task,"This study has two main themes. The first is concerned with re-examining the relationship between 'ordinary' and 'special' education in the light of developments in thinking and practice over the past decade. A case study approach was used to explore the limits and limitations of the thesis that 'special educational needs' can be most effectively addressed as part of a process of general curriculum critique and development designed to benefit all children. Pursuing questions and concerns arising from my own experience as a support teacher, the aim of the research was to establish if there is still a place for a concept of 'special' education consistent with this interpretation of the task and, if so, on what basis a distinction might now legitimately be made.



Individual children's responses to a particular instance of general curriculum development (in the teaching and learning of writing) were observed, and samples of their writing collected, over a period of several months. The analysis of this material highlighted the need for, and the means to articulate, a discourse and interpretive procedure for responding to concerns about individual children's learning which reflect and enact the critique of 'learning difficulties' understood as an individual problem. Having reformulated the original thesis to include an individual dimension, the study concludes that what is needed to resolve the questions raised initially is not, after all, a new distinction between 'ordinary' and 'special' education, but a distinction of a quite different order: one which draws attention to different kinds of professional thinking, and highlights the critical and innovative nature of the thinking required.



The second, subsidiary theme is a methodological one. It explores what the study itself may have to contribute to the establishment of a mode of research derived from teaching. Claiming to use no 'methods' other than the interpretive resources and experience of a teacher, the study uses its own processes to explore and establish its methodological status, and in particular to consider the significance of prior experience in the development of new knowledge about education"
432,Role of non-executive directors in corporate governance in the context of the codes on corporate governance,"This thesis investigates the role of the Non-Executive Directors (NEDs) of the listed companies in the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) in the UK. Literature review on general theoretical framework on corporate governance and on the role of NEDs shows that there is a paradoxical compliance, that is the implementation of the statutory and non-statutory codes on corporate governance to minimise the corporate governance problems such as exploitation of the assets of shareholders by the management, corporate collapses, accounting frauds and so on yet the same problems emerging again and again. Therefore, the re-examination of the role of NEDs was identified as the intellectual problem for this thesis.



A review into the existing research methodologies and research methods led to understand the need to design a research methodology for replication in the same research context or another research context to ensure reliability and validity of the research methodology and methods selected. Two research methods were chosen to collect data that is content analysis and postal questionnaire survey. The main  theoretical framework used in this research is the Role Theory.



The goal of this research is to understand the role of the NEDs in the context of the implementation of the non-regulatory Codes on Corporate Governance. The aim is to design the research methodology only after making a review into the strengths and weaknesses of the existing research methodologies into the role of the NEDs. The objective is to execute the same with a view to identify a model on the role of NEDs useful for the corporate sector in Sri Lanka.



Thesis argues the rational of explaining the role of the NEDs in several categories such as strategy, advice, monitoring and service in previous research. This research finds a multiple number of tasks of NEDs as well as diversity among the tasks. Further it argues that the role of NEDs is conditioned by the expectations of the stakeholders as well as with their own cognitive disposition.



Thesis contributes to knowledge in number of ways namely: (1) role of NEDs in AIM companies, (2) a review of general theoretical framework on corporate governance in the context of the implementation of non-regulatory codes on corporate governance, (3) a review of corporate governance experience in Sri Lanka and (4) some methodological developments for the content analysis technique namely use of Chi square test statistics to prove the protection of two properties of content analysis that is mutual exhaustiveness and mutual exclusiveness.



Subject to several limitations arising from the inherent weaknesses in sampling and data collection, thesis certainly makes a contribution to understand the role of the NEDs in the modern corporation as well as to design a model on the role of NEDs in Sri Lanka which is planning to implement a non-regulatory code on corporate governance"
433,A rock or a hard place? Teaching assistants supporting physically disabled pupils in mainstream secondary school physical education: the tensions of professionalising the role,"As a Physical Education (PE) teacher in both special and mainstream schools over a 15 year period, I witnessed the use of the teaching assistant (or Learning Support Assistant as they were known) for purposes which might be deemed to be related to a medical/welfare/care-giver role. In addition, previous small-scale research into the experiences of secondary-age disabled pupils in mainstream as opposed to special school PE showed that their experiences in an inclusive setting were restricted and that the presence of a TA did little to rectify this situation (Farr, 2005). Recently, the professionalisation of the role of the TA may have created a ‘teacher-in-waiting’ (Neill, 2002) and thus the nature of the TA’s role in PE, and the ability of the specialist teacher to work collaboratively with them is complex. 



This mixed methods study, inspired by critical ethnography (Thomas, 1993, 2003) incorporated five techniques of enquiry initially based on the work of Giangreco and Broer (2005). In keeping with a constructionist paradigm and integrating what I have termed a distorical  theoretical perspective, I counted the interaction between people and the social structure in which they operated as important (Crotty, 1998, Broido, 2002) and drew on dominant participant voices (Lincoln and Guba, 2003). Adopting a theoretical perspective grounded in disability studies, I explored the perceptions of the role of the TA in inclusive PE through qualitative and quantitative data and presented a role definition which combines the humanistic with the instructional (or professional) after Reiter, 2000. I argued whether responsibility for the child’s learning should be devolved through the TA. Do we use the TA to make the teacher’s life easier or to support, collaboratively, the inclusion of the disabled pupil?



The impact of this study on professional practice relates to the clarity of role definition for TAs generally and for TAs specifically who work in PE; the collaborative nature (or otherwise) of the TA/teacher relationship and the implications of these findings for the future training and deployment of teaching assistants in PE with a physically disabled pupil in a mainstream secondary school. This study found that TAs in PE share many traits or characteristics with those TAs working in other subject disciplines, or across subjects. However, in PE they were inclined to rate a willingness and ability to ‘join in’ and participate in practical activities alongside pupils above pedagogical knowledge. Training either reinforces an instructional or coaching role, or it focuses on the caring or medical aspects. The reality for the TA in this study however, is that they neither define themselves as one or the other but see themselves as drawing on their own skills, empathy and initiative to facilitate a positive, inclusive environment, with or without the input of the PE teacher. They deem themselves to be both care-givers where appropriate as well as supporters of autonomous participation (as opposed to learning). That the professionalization of their role moves them towards the pedagogical places the TA between a rock and a hard place"
434,Ten years of Ana: lessons from a transdisciplinary body of literature on online pro-eating disorder websites,"This paper offers a methodical review of the scientific literature of the last decade that concerns itself with online services offering supportive advocacy for anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa (‘pro-ana’ and ‘pro-mia’). The main question is whether these studies reproduce the traditional divide in the study of eating disorders, between clinical and social science perspectives, with limited mutual exchanges. Having first identified a specific body of literature, the authors investigate its content, methods and approaches, and analyse the network of cross-citations the components generate and share. On this basis, the authors argue that the scientific literature touching on pro-ana websites can be regarded as a single

transdisciplinary body of knowledge. What’s more, they show that the literature on computermediated sociabilities centred on eating disorders displays different structural characteristics with respect to the traditional, non-Web-related research on eating disorders. In the latter, the social sciences have usually provided a critical  counterpoint to the development of a health sciences mainstream. In the case of Web-related research, however, the social sciences have taken the lead role in defining the field, with the health sciences following suit"
435,The role of weather and topography in the airborne dispersal of particulate matter in Kent,"Local weather data (wind direction, wind speed and temperature) from meteorological stations and daily synoptic data have been examined in relation to airborne particulate material (PM10) concentrations recorded at 17 pollution monitoring sites throughout Kent for the period 2000 to 2008, as an aid to understanding dispersal patterns in relation to topography.



In general, local and synoptic wind direction patterns followed the same trends: the yearly distribution is dominated by southwesterly winds, followed by winds from the west and the northwest. Detailed analysis of local wind patterns at four sites (two coastal and two inland) strongly suggested the presence of seas breezes, reaching maximum frequency between March and August and fewest occurrences between November and February. Transport of PM10 over 30 km inland was also inferred.



In addition to local wind transport, the location of the pollution monitoring sites and their environment are key to explaining the differences in PM10 concentrations recorded between the sites. The 10 sites located on roadsides registered the highest number of particle counts, followed by the five sites located within urban areas. The lowest amount of particles was found at the two rural sites. The five roadside sites closest to London (two in Gravesham and three in Dartford) exceeded the daily recommended amount of 50 μg/m3 several times each month, probably reflecting the increased road traffic in those areas.



Aside from the variation in PM10 amount between sites, seasonal differences were also observed, with the lowest amount of PM10 recorded in the autumn and the highest in spring.



Episodes of pollution affecting the whole of Kent were also observed. These were more clearly related to the synoptic situation rather than any local wind variations and appear to indicate regional or trans-boundary pollution transport. The latter is also supported by preliminary evidence from a PM10 trap sampling at a site on the south coast"
436,"‘Between two lives': parenting and impacts on academic, professional achievements and socio-emotional outcomes for British-Ghanaians","Research undertaken within the Sociology of Education frequently highlights concerns about the underachievement of Black students in education and, later, within the labour market. Yet, there are a number of shortcomings associated with research in this area. Firstly, there is a tendency to homogenise the achievement levels of all Black students. Thus observations made about the outcomes of African-Caribbean students are often applied to all other Black groups. When distinctions between African and African Caribbean groups have been made, the achievement levels of students from different African backgrounds are often merged, creating a misleading impression of their different academic outcomes. Secondly, studies seeking to provide explanations for the low attainment levels of Black students are often critical of life within Black families, in particular their assumed use of an „authoritarian‟ parenting style, which is seen as creating psychological problems in children and as hindering their achievement. Effectively, such notions serve to pathologise Black families in Britain. This thesis presents a critique of existing studies concerning Black families in Britain and the academic achievement of Black (African) children, and also seeks to address existing gaps in the knowledge about Black Africans residing in Britain. Life history interviews were conducted with 25 British-Ghanaians who have achieved highly in their academic and professional pursuits. The findings suggest that not all parents adopted an „authoritarian‟ approach when raising their children, and that those who did were influenced by their own socialisation experiences in Ghana. While some respondents experienced some socio-emotional problems resulting from their „authoritarian‟ socialisation, these were generally resolved and did not have a long-term impact on their attainment. The thesis also suggests that the use of discipline, associated with this parenting style, may have had some beneficial effects in relation to respondents‟ academic and professional outcomes"

439,"'Bringing me more than I contain': Levinas, ethical subjectivity and the infinite demands of education","Emmanuel Levinas' s reorientation of ethics as preceding ontology and his radical\ud
presentation of responsibility, justice, consciousness and knowledge are of clear\ud
relevance for education. It is therefore not surprising that in the last decade we have\ud
seen a number of studies ofLevinas by educational theorists.\ud
Much of this work has focused on Levinas's relevance for issues of ethics, social\ud
justice, multiculturalism and moral education. This thesis draws on this previous\ud
research, but aims to take educational readings of Levinas in another direction\ud
through considering how his presentation of discourse, language and subjectivity, as\ud
dependent on an infinite ethical demand, troubles several dominant orientations\ud
within educational discourse that treat education in ways that can become totalising\ud
and instrumentalist.\ud
I begin by offering a philosophical analysis of how Levinas describes the scene of\ud
teaching and the nature of subjectivity. I then interrogate how this reading of Levinas\ud
disturbs some current understandings of education: first, the way that, within\ud
liberalism, education can be conceived instrumentally as the site for the development\ud
of a certain kind of individual (a rationally autonomous chooser, etc.), and second, the\ud
way that neoliberal educational ideologies have privileged managerialism,\ud
performance and the market, with Religious Education providing a case study of the\ud
implications of Levinas's interruption. I then consider how this leads to new\ud
understandings of community and political subjectivity within education.\ud
In this way, I explore how responding to Levinas, and reading his work together with\ud
criticisms addressed by Badiou and others, leads us not just to a richer vision of the\ud
meaning of education, but also to a more motivating understanding of the ethical\ud
subjectivity of both students and teachers, which is dependent on a deepening and anarchic\ud
responsibility, and which invites us to work for a better education extending\ud
beyond the straight line ofthe law"

444,Optimising subdomain aspect ratios for parallel load balancing,"In parallel adaptive Finite Element simulations the work load 011the individual processors can change frequently. To (re)distribute the load evenly over the processors a load balancing heuristic is needed. Common strategies try to minimise subdomain dependencies by minimising the number of cut edges in the partition. For many solvers this is the most influential factor. However for example, for certain preconditioned Conjugate Gradient solvers this cutsize can play only a minor role, but their convergence can be highly dependent on the subdomain shapes. Degenerated subdomain shapes can cause them to need significantly more iterations to converge. Common heuristics often fail to address these requirements. In this thesis a new strategy is introduced which directly addresses the problem of generating and conserving reasonably good subdomain shapes while balancing the load in a dynamically changing Finite Element Simulation. A new definition of Aspect Ratio is presented which assesses subdomain shapes. The common methodology of using adjacency information to select the best elements to be migrated is not considered since it is not necessarily related to the subdomain shapes. Instead, geometric data is used to formulate several cost functions to rate elements in terms of their suitability to be migrated. The well known diffusive and Generalised Dimension Exchange methods which calculate the necessary load flow are enhanced by weighting the subdomain edges in order to influence their impact on the resulting partition positively. The results of comprehensive tests are presented and demonstrate that the proposed methods are competitive with state-of-the-art load balancing tools"

584,Global monitoring report 2015/2016: development goals in an era of demographic change,"This report details the progress the world has made towards global development goals and examines the impact of demographic change on achieving these goals.

Executive summary

With 2015 marking the transition from the Millennium to the Sustainable Development Goals, the international community can celebrate many development successes since 2000. Despite the global financial crisis, economic growth was generally strong and robust.

About 1 billion people rose out of extreme poverty. Most developing countries saw solid income growth for the bottom 40 percent of their income distribution. Millions of children who were unlikely to survive their fifth birthday passed beyond these critical years and went on to school in ever greater numbers.

The incidence of preventable diseases such as AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis is falling. The share of those with access to clean water and better sanitation has risen.

Overall, the Millennium Development Goals played an important role in galvanizing the global development community, and that experience will help drive progress toward achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030"
585,The longitudinal study of Australian children annual statistical report 2014,"Introduction

Growing Up in Australia: The Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC) is Australia\u27s first nationally representative longitudinal study of child development. The purpose of the study is to provide data that enable a comprehensive understanding of development and life-course trajectories within Australia\u27s current social, economic and cultural environment. The longitudinal nature of the study enables researchers to examine the dynamics of change through the life course as children develop, and to go beyond the static pictures provided by cross-sectional statistics. The study thereby gives policy-makers and researchers access to quality data about children\u27s development in the contemporary Australian environment.

The study was initiated and is funded by the Australian Government Department of Social Services, and is conducted in partnership with the Australian Institute of Family Studies (AIFS) and the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). A consortium of leading researchers and experts from universities and research agencies provide advice to the study.

This is the fifth volume in the LSAC Annual Statistical Report series, which uses data from the fifth wave of the study for the first time. The purpose of these reports is to provide a snapshot of some of the data from the study and to address policy-relevant questions about aspects of Australian children\u27s lives and development. The report makes use of the longitudinal nature of LSAC data to describe the dynamics of change as children develop, and how their families and lives change as they grow olde"

587,"Educating cultural heritage information professionals for Australia&#039;s galleries, libraries, archives and museums","This research explored the skills, knowledge and qualities, and professional education needs, of information professionals in galleries, libraries, archives and museums (GLAM) in Australia.&nbsp; These cultural heritage institutions have always had a role in allowing us to experience, explore and interpret our world by enabling people to engage with information in multiple forms through their mutual core functions of acquiring, organising, storing, providing access to and preserving information.

&nbsp;

With the advent of the digital environment, the role of the information professional has grown, but so too have the opportunities for making the collections of Australia’s cultural heritage institutions available, including the increased ability for collaboration and convergence between institutions.&nbsp; The need to educate information professionals who can operate across these blurred cultural heritage boundaries is becoming paramount if we are to maximize the use of our rich collections of cultural heritage information.

&nbsp;

This research identified similarities in skills, knowledge and qualities using the Grounded Delphi method, a relatively new methodological extension of the Delphi method.&nbsp; It integrates aspects of Grounded Theory – particularly with respect to the data analysis - with the Delphi method, a group communication tool and a means to achieve consensus.&nbsp; The process consisted of three rounds of data collection: this first was exploratory focus groups, followed by two rounds of online questionnaires. In keeping with Delphi procedures, an ‘a priori’ consensus level was set at 75%. &nbsp;Of the 74 questions that participants had to answer, 57 reached consensus.

&nbsp;

The findings revealed that although full convergence of galleries, libraries, archives and museums is unlikely, many of the skills, knowledge and qualities would be required across all four GLAM sectors.&nbsp; However, some skills may require a ‘change of focus’ in the digital environment.&nbsp; Key findings included the need to ‘understand why we do what we do’; ‘understand the broad purpose of our role’; ‘the need to better articulate the profession’s existence and its role in social capacity building’; and the need for broader, more generalist skills, but without losing any specialist capacity.&nbsp; The findings provide the first empirically based guidelines around what needs to be included in an educational framework for information professionals who will work in the emerging GLAM environment.&nbsp; A further recommendation is to consider establishing an undergraduate degree where the broader, cross-disciplinary skills and knowledge are taught in an Information Management/ Informatics focussed program.

&nbsp;

As the first study of GLAM education requirements in Australia and the wider Asia-Pacific region to take a holistic approach by engaging information professionals across all four types of cultural heritage institutions, this thesis makes a significant contribution to the GLAM research field and to information education generally"
588,Literature review of the impact of early childhood education and care on learning and development,"Summary

During the past three decades, extensive literature has accumulated on the early years of life for children. Research findings unequivocally agree that these years are a critical period of
intense learning for children which provides the foundation for later academic and social success. This review explores the literature on the complex relationship between developmental outcomes and attendance at early childhood education and care programs.

0–3 years: within a child care setting


	Attendance at child care in the first 3 years of life has no strong effects on cognitive and language development for children who are not disadvantaged at home, provided child
	care is of a high quality (CCCH 2007).
	Quality is key: poor quality child care was found to produce deficits in language and cognitive function for young children (Productivity Commission 2014).
	Studies on the impact of quantity of child care for 0–3 year olds were inconclusive. Some studies reported better intellectual development, improved independence and improved concentration and sociability at school entry; other studies reported lower-rated learning abilities and an elevated risk of developing antisocial behaviour in the future (Sammons et al. 2012; Sylva et al. 2010).
	Other reported benefits of attendance at high-quality child care include less impulsivity, more advanced expressive vocabulary, and greater reported social competence (Belsky et al. 2007).
	Children from disadvantaged backgrounds show the greatest gains from attending high-quality child care (Elliott 2006; Moore 2006).


3–5 years: within a preschool setting


	Stand-alone preschools and day care with preschool programs were both reported to promote cognitive and social development benefits, with evidence of improved performance in standardised tests in the early years of primary school (Warren &amp; Haisken-DeNew 2013).
	Number of months of attendance at preschool is related to better intellectual development and improved independence, concentration and sociability (Sammons et al. 2012).
	Full-time attendance at preschool led to no more significant gains than part-time attendance (Sammons et al. 2012).
	Longitudinal studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of high-quality, focused preschool programs in reducing the effects of social disadvantage, developing children’s social competency and emotional health, and preparing children for a successful transition to school. Benefits were optimised when children from different social backgrounds attended the same preschool program (Sylva et al. 2004).
	Children living in disadvantaged communities, those not proficient in English, and Indigenous children were identified as particularly vulnerable and most likely to benefit from high-quality preschool programs (Baxter &amp; Hand 2013; Hewitt &amp; Walter 2014).
	Programs aimed at increasing the attendance of these vulnerable children at preschool programs need to be culturally sensitive (Harrison et al. 2012; Mann et al. 2011)"
589,Countering violent extremism: developing an evidence-base for policy and practice,"Overview

This volume reports on the range of papers presented at the Annual Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) Research Conference 2014 from 7-8 December 2014 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. The Conference was organized and hosted by Hedayah (the International Center of Excellence for Countering Violent Extremism), Curtin University, People Against Violent Extremism (PaVE), and the Australian Government, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT). The Conference was also sponsored in part by the European Commission and the United States Department of State. The event was attended by approximately 100 academics, practitioners and policymakers from over 25 countries. The 2014 CVE Research Conference follows from the inaugural CVE Symposium hosted by Curtin University, PaVE, Macquarie University and Hedayah in Perth, Australia in 2013. As the first of its kind in the region, the 2013 Symposium brought together national and international scholars, practitioners, policymakers and former extremists to discuss and debate the current state and future directions for CVE. The intention for the CVE Research Conference is to be an annual event at which the yearly highlights of cutting-edge CVE research and innovation can be presented to academics, researchers, practitioners and policymakers on a global scale.

In an age where the threat of terrorism from non-state actors is on the rise and traditional counter-terrorism policies do not seem to be reducing terrorism worldwide, governments are looking towards strategies, policies and programs to interrupt radicalization and recruitment into violent extremism and terrorism. These interventions are known as preventing or countering violent extremism (P/CVE) or countering violent extremism and radicalization that lead to terrorism (VERLT) by a number of international stakeholders and governments. For the purposes of the Conference and this edited volume, the concept of CVE refers to the programs and policies for countering and preventing radicalization and recruitment into violent extremism and terrorism as part of an overall counter-terrorism strategy and framework. This definition is inclusive of strategic, non-coercive counterterrorism programs and policies including those involving education and broad-based community engagement; more targeted narrative/messaging programs and counter-recruitment strategies; disengagement and targeted intervention programs for individuals engaging in radicalization; as well as de-radicalization, disengagement and rehabilitation programs for former violent extremist offenders"

This report contains recommendations in relation to the provision of effective redress for survivors through the establishment, funding and operation of a single national redress scheme and the provision of a direct personal response to survivors by institutions. This report also contains recommendations for reforms to civil litigation systems to make civil litigation a more effective means of providing justice for survivors.

The Royal Commission is investigating criminal justice issues (including processes for referral for investigation and prosecution) and support services separately. It will report in relation to them in later reports"
591,"Alternative to private finance of the welfare state: a global analysis of Social Impact Bond, Pay-for-Success and Development Impact Bond projects","Overview

Social impact bond projects are the latest new ‘buy-now, pay later’, off-balance sheet schemes to increase private finance of public services and the welfare state, driven by austerity policies and neoliberal ideology.

They are a complex venture capitalist model applied to the provision of social services, health, education and other public services. Private investors provide working capital to social impact bond projects with the expectation of an annual rate of return or profit of 15% - 30% or more, dependent on the achievement of specified outcomes.

Early intervention/development and prevention are only part of a strategy to tackle the root causes of poverty and inequality. However, social impact bonds and pay-for-success are designed to deliver selective social outcomes.

The social impact bond project lobby embrace neoliberalism and a ‘government failure’ model to justify their approach, but they are in denial of market failure and the cause of the global financial crisis. The social impact bond project lobby is, however, happy to accept public money in the form of tax breaks, grants, subsidies and guarantees to extend corporate welfare. Nearly £520m of UK public money has been given to social enterprises and social impact bond projects in recent years in the form of grants and financial support.

International bodies have advanced the case for social impact bonds projects - the G8 group of countries established a Social Impact Investment Taskforce, the Organisation for Economic Development and Cooperation (OECD) and World Economic Forum (2013) extolling their virtues.

Global banks such as Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Co. and Morgan Stanley, have played a key role in promoting and funding social impact bond projects in anticipation of attracting wider private investor interest and a new ‘asset class’.

There are currently 54 operational social impact bond projects in 13 countries with at least a further 23 at the planning or procurement stage. The UK is the global leader with 32 operational projects with outcome payments valued at £91m, followed by the US with 9 projects"
592,Enhancing the implementation of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Child Placement Principle: policy and practice considerations,"Overview

The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Child Placement Principle (""the Principle"") was developed in recognition of the devastating effects of forced separation of Indigenous children from families, communities and culture. The Principle exists in legislation and policy in all Australian jurisdictions, and while its importance is recognised in many boards of inquiry and reviews into child protection and justice systems, there are significant concerns about the implementation of the Principle. Recent estimates suggest the Principle has been fully applied in as few as 13% of child protection cases involving Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. The purpose of this paper is to explore the contemporary understanding of the Principle, and review the multiple and complex barriers at the policy and practice levels which are impeding its implementation. Promising approaches that might address these barriers are also examined.

Key messages


	The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Child Placement Principle was developed in response to the trauma experienced by individuals, families and communities from government policies that involved the widespread removal of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. 
	The fundamental goal of the Principle is to enhance and preserve Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children’s connection to family and community, and sense of identity and culture. 
	The Principle is often conceptualised as the “placement hierarchy”, in which placement choices for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children start with family and kin networks, then Indigenous non-related carers in the child’s community, then carers in another Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander community. If no other suitable placement with Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander carers can be sought, children are placed with non-Indigenous carers as a last resort, provided they are able to maintain the child’s connections to their family, community and cultural identity"
593,Defending Australia: a history of Australia’s defence white papers,"This paper provides a summary of each of Australia’s defence white papers issued between 1976 and 2013 and seeks to draw out common themes that emerge in some or all of them.

Executive summary


	Australia published defence white papers in 1976, 1987, 1994, 2000, 2009 and 2013 and a new white paper is expected in 2015.
	A community consultation process was undertaken as part of the 2000 and 2009 defence white papers and a similar process is being carried out for the upcoming 2015 defence white paper.
	The need to defend Australia against a major aggressor remains the primary driver in Australian defence policy.
	Regional security and contributing to the global order have been secondary, but still important priorities in Australian defence planning.
	Each of the defence white papers has been created on the basis that Australia should be able to defend itself against a potential aggressor without outside assistance (the principle of self-reliance), while at the same time stressing the importance of the alliance with the United States.
	Threat perceptions have changed from the Cold War influences reflected in the 1976 and 1987 white papers to a contemporary focus on terrorism while also incorporating emerging threats such as cyber attacks and the rise of China.
	Defence white papers are not produced in a vacuum but are informed by key reviews of Australia’s strategic situation, industry policy and force posture.
	Defence policy is subject to the broader economic conditions of the time and the Department of Defence must contend with many other priorities for government funding.
	The financial plans set out in the various defence white papers are often ambitious and rarely brought to fruition.
	On the whole, capability choices have displayed continuity between the different white papers regardless of changes in government. This is understandable given the length of time required for major capital equipment acquisitions.
	Recent white papers have placed a greater emphasis on regional engagement.
	The contribution of the Australian Defence Force (ADF) to humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations, as well as to border protection activities, has also been included in the most recent white papers"
594,Toward a transformed system to address child abuse and family violence in New Zealand,"Executive Summary 

Introduction The Glenn Inquiry (TGI) has contracted Institute of Environmental Science and Research Limited (ESR) to bring together the relevant experience and expertise to collaboratively model a transformed system to address child abuse and neglect (CAN) and family violence (FV) in New Zealand.

Our approach 

We have treated the task of reducing FV and CAN as a ‘wicked problem’1; that is, reducing FV and CAN is a problem that cannot be solved once and for all, and is not a matter of simply applying expert knowledge. The methods used in this project have been chosen because they are appropriate for working with wicked problems: stakeholder engagement, systems thinking and inter-disciplinary analysis.

In this report, we refer to both CAN and FV. We recognise that, for some purposes, dealing with CAN requires particular strategies and treatment; however, the purpose of this report is to develop a transformed system that will reduce both CAN and other forms of FV. While the underlying causes of CAN and other FV may be considered independently, and some responses to each form of abuse will need to be particular, this report proposes a wider system of responses that will enable targeted interventions for each form of abuse.

We use the term ‘family violence’ in this report in the sense it has come to be understood in Aotearoa, and is used in Te Rito: New Zealand Family Violence Prevention Strategy. In this use, FV includes intimate partner violence, child abuse and neglect, elder abuse, inter-sibling abuse and parental abuse.

The project consisted of four work-streams:


	
	A review of the international and national literature on what would constitute a high performing system to address CAN and FV, including a review of New Zealand’s current approach with a focus on government legalisation, policies and initiatives;
	
	
	Qualitative modelling of the system dynamics associated with the existing way in which New Zealand has responded to CAN and FV;
	
	
	A secondary (sociological) analysis of suggestions for system improvement from the People’s Report; and,
	
	
	Developing a systemic model of a transformed system through collaborative workshops with sector experts"
595,Health initiatives to target obesity in surface transport  industries: review and implications for action,"Lifestyle-related chronic diseases pose a considerable burden to the individual and the wider society,&nbsp;with correspondingly negative effects on industry. Obesity is a particular problem for the Australasian&nbsp;road and rail industries where it is associated with specific cardiac and fatigue-related safety risks, and&nbsp;levels are higher than those found in the general population. Despite this recognition, and the&nbsp;introduction of National Standards, very little consensus exists regarding approaches to preventative&nbsp;health for surface transport workers. A review of evidence regarding effective health promotion&nbsp;initiatives is urgently needed to inform best practice in this cohort. This review draws together research&nbsp;informing the scope and effectiveness of health promotion programs, initiatives and interventions&nbsp;targeting overweight and obesity in safety critical surface transport domains including the truck, bus&nbsp;and rail industries. A number of health interventions demonstrated measurable successes, including&nbsp;incentivising, peer mentoring, verbal counselling, development of personalised health profiles, and&nbsp;offer of healthier on-site food choices – some of which also resulted in sizeable return on investment&nbsp;over the long term.

&nbsp"
596,Self-tracking modes: reflexive self-monitoring and data practices,"The concept of ‘self-tracking’ (also referred to as life-logging, the quantified self, personal analytics and personal informatics) has recently begun to emerge in discussions of ways in which people can voluntarily monitor and record specific features of their lives, often using digital technologies. There is evidence that the personal data that are derived from individuals engaging in such reflexive self-monitoring are now beginning to be used by actors, agencies and organisations beyond the personal and privatised realm.

Self-tracking rationales and sites are proliferating as part of a ‘function creep’ of the technology and ethos of self-tracking. The detail offered by these data on individuals and the growing commodification and commercial value of digital data have led government, managerial and commercial enterprises to explore ways of appropriating self-tracking for their own purposes. In some contexts people are encouraged, ‘nudged’, obliged or coerced into using digital devices to produce personal data which are then used by others.

This paper examines these issues, outlining five modes of self-tracking that have emerged: private, communal, pushed, imposed and exploited. The analysis draws upon theoretical perspectives on concepts of selfhood, citizenship, biopolitics and data practices and assemblages in discussing the wider sociocultural implications of the emergence and development of these modes of self-tracking"
597,Conversations about alcohol and pregnancy,"New research funded by the Foundation for Alcohol Research and Education (FARE) and undertaken by the University of Canberra’s News and Media Research Centre, titled \u27Conversations about alcohol and pregnancy\u27, has found that women receive and actively interpret contradictory information about the risks of drinking alcohol while pregnant from a number of sources.

The project examined media reporting of alcohol consumption and its risks during pregnancy and how Canberra women understand the issue and manage and apply different types of information about it, including media reporting, expert advice and public health guidelines. The research highlights women’s situated knowledge as a vital part of the public conversation about alcohol and pregnancy.

Five key frames were identified from the analysis of 110 media items. These frames were: ‘contested evidence and advice’, ‘FASD crisis’, ‘blame risk-taking mothers’, ‘women’s rights’, and ‘community responsibility’. The dominant frame was ‘contested evidence and advice’, which highlighted contradictory medical advice and research findings. Such stories were typically sourced to new published research variously highlighting evidence of harm or no harm to the fetus from alcohol consumption.

Interviews with 20 Canberra women revealed variable experiences and responses to media reporting and public health guidelines about alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Women’s views paralleled the polarities of the ‘contested evidence and advice’ frame identified in the media analysis. Some women discussed uncertainty surrounding its potential impacts, including fear of FASD, as part of their reasoning for abstaining from alcohol, while others were of the view that the occasional drink was acceptable and not going to be harmful. Some women emphasised the importance of listening to their own bodies and being comfortable with having a drink if they felt like it. Some women viewed the abstinence public health advice as a responsible message, while others interpreted it as an example of policing women through guilt.

The research findings are situated in the context of the 2009 NHMRC alcohol guidelines; increasing concern about Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD); concern that some women continue to drink during pregnancy; increasing media attention to women’s drinking; ideas of ‘good’ and ‘bad’ mothers; risk as a dominant discourse surrounding pregnancy and motherhood; media as a source of public understandings about alcohol risks and control policies; and variable information and advice available to women about the risks of drinking alcohol during pregnancy"
598,Review of government initiatives for reconciling work and family life,"Presents a review of government initiatives that help families balance their work and family responsibilities, highlighting innovative ideas and including a discussion of international trends and themes.

Summary





This AIFS Research Report presents a review of government initiatives that help families balance their work and family responsibilities, highlighting innovative ideas and including a discussion of international trends and themes. Most of the information reviewed in this report pertains to OECD countries, especially New Zealand and countries in the European Union, as work and family policies have been extensively developed in these countries. Some East Asian countries have also been included, and for some countries, state (as opposed to federal) policies are discussed. The wide range of policies that have been used in different countries, combined with significant variation in approaches, means that those reviewed in this report are necessarily selective, and much of the discussion is quite broad. This review particularly focuses on government policies and approaches that address work and family issues for people with caring responsibilities for children or the elderly. The report outlines some of the broader aims, approaches and considerations of governments in the area of work and family, and then reviews policies related to leave and return-to-work policies; child care, child payments and early childhood education; working hours and other aspects of employment; and governance, support and promotion of work–family initiatives. This review reflects work–family policies that have recently been implemented (up to 2014) across developed countries, but not necessarily the state of play at the time of publication"
599,Cultural competency in the delivery of health services for Indigenous people,"Aim and objectives

This review aims to examine available evidence on cultural competence in health care settings to identify key approaches and strategies that can contribute to improving the development and implementation of Indigenous health services and programs. The objectives are to:

1. define cultural competency
–– we consider the significance of cultural competence and how it has been defined in international and local literature, including the use of similar terms and meanings

2. report on the quantity, nature and quality of available evidence
–– we look at available evidence on cultural competency in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United States, including how cultural competence has been measured, and assess the quality of the evidence against basic methodological criteria

3. identify approaches and strategies that are effective in improving cultural competency among health services staff

4. examine the relationship between cultural competency and health outcomes

5. develop an evidence-informed conceptual framework of cultural competency"
600,Evaluation of BoysTown&#039;s Expressive Therapies Intervention 2012-2014,"BoysTown’s Expressive Therapies Intervention (BETI) is a trauma and attachment informed creative arts and play therapy intervention. The initiative is targeted at young children with emotional and behavioural problems stemming from exposure to traumatic life and family experiences, including attachment trauma. It aims to improve participants’ emotional and social wellbeing and competence; behavioural adjustment; quality of attachment relationships with parents; and self-concept/self-esteem. To support the achievement of these objectives, the intervention is integrated within case-managed support programs for disadvantaged families.

This report describes BETI’s therapeutic model and presents the findings of a two-year evaluation including analysis of the following client outcome data:


	pre and post intervention assessments using the Child Behaviour Checklist
	parent surveys, and
	therapists’ end-of-therapy reports.


Together the findings suggest that BETI, delivered in the context of holistic family support programs, contributes to improvements in the quality of preschool-aged children’s attachment relationships with their caregivers and helps to address a range of emotional and behavioural impacts of developmental trauma. These findings are especially noteworthy in view of the wealth of research regarding the impacts of developmental trauma and insecure attachment on normal development and long term social and emotional wellbeing"
601,Dropping off the edge 2015: persistent communal disadvantage in Australia,"This report shows that complex and entrenched disadvantage is experienced by a small but persistent number of locations in each state and territory across Australia.

Foreword

In 2007, Jesuit Social Services and Catholic Social Services Australia commissioned ground-breaking research into place-based disadvantage across the nation. The resulting report, Dropping off the edge, built on previous work that Jesuit Social Services had engaged Professor Tony Vinson to undertake on its behalf and quickly became a critical resource for governments, service providers and communities attempting to address the challenge of entrenched and often complex geographical disadvantage.

That report received over 284 scholarly citations and supported the establishment of the Australian Social Inclusion Board – a body charged with identifying long-term strategies to end poverty in Australia.

Since the publication of Dropping off the edge, our organisations have received many requests to update the findings and produce a new report tracking the wellbeing of communities in Australia over the intervening time.

Sadly, the current report drives home the enormous challenge that lies in front of our policy makers and service providers, as many communities identified as disadvantaged in 2007 once again head the list in each state and territory.

As a society we cannot, and should not, turn away from the challenge of persistent and entrenched locational disadvantage, no matter how difficult it may be to solve the problem.

We call on government, community and business to come together to work alongside these communities to ensure long term sustainable change.

We hold hope that the young people and future generations in these communities will have a better outlook and life opportunities than is currently available to them. It is our belief that every Australian should have access to the opportunities in life that will enable them to flourish – to complete their education, to get a job, to access safe and affordable housing, to raise their children in safe communities and to see the next generation thrive.

602,"The IUCN Red List of Ecosystems: motivations, challenges, and applications","Abstract 

In response to growing demand for ecosystem-level risk assessment in biodiversity conservation, and rapid proliferation of locally tailored protocols, the IUCN recently endorsed new Red List criteria as a global standard for ecosystem risk assessment. Four qualities were sought in the design of the IUCN criteria: generality; precision; realism; and simplicity. Drawing from extensive global consultation, we explore trade-offs among these qualities when dealing with key challenges, including ecosystem classification, measuring ecosystem dynamics, degradation and collapse, and setting decision thresholds to delimit ordinal categories of threat. Experience from countries with national lists of threatened ecosystems demonstrates well-balanced trade-offs in current and potential applications of Red Lists of Ecosystems in legislation, policy, environmental management and education. The IUCN Red List of Ecosystems should be judged by whether it achieves conservation ends and improves natural resource management, whether its limitations are outweighed by its benefits, and whether it performs better than alternative methods. Future development of the Red List of Ecosystems will benefit from the history of the Red List of Threatened Species which was trialed and adjusted iteratively over 50 years from rudimentary beginnings. We anticipate the Red List of Ecosystems will promote policy focus on conservation outcomes in situ across whole landscapes and seascapes"
603,The media and Indigenous policy: how news media reporting and mediatized practice impact on Indigenous policy,"The Media and Indigenous Policy Report is an outcome of \u27The Australian News Media and Indigenous Policymaking 1988-2008\u27 project, funded by an ARC Discovery Project grant. It&nbsp; investigated how journalism impacts on the development of Indigenous social policy. Analysis of media and policy texts, and interviews with experts from government, media and Indigenous advocacy organisations provided rich insights into the changing nature of news media reporting and the impact of increasingly ‘mediatized’ policymaking practice.

The project explored the relationships between journalism and Indigenous policymaking in Australia from 1988 to 2008. The researchers investigated the media representation of Indigenous health, education and communication, and the development of Indigenous policies over a 20-year period.

Through analyses of policy documents, media releases, speeches and media texts, the researchers mapped the changing nature of Indigenous policy and its representation in public media. They interviewed journalists, public spokespeople and policymakers to examine processes involved in the shifting nature and reporting of Indigenous policy in Australia"
604,School autonomy: necessary but not sufficient,"School autonomy has become increasingly significant in the politics of education, as well as a central feature of education systems’ reform policies in Australia and globally. This review examines the spectrum of evidence on the impact of school autonomy on student academic achievement, and the features of autonomy that improve or constrain achievement, and discusses the implications of these findings for future policy. There is no definitive or simple conclusion from assessing the impact of autonomy on student achievement, but neither does the evidence reject the contribution of autonomy. Rather, the evidence points to autonomy as a key and necessary component of a mature and high-performing system, as it is in other areas of public administration. However, the wider institutional context matters, and parallel policies like accountability and leadership development need to be in place. Crucially, and counter to popular conception, more rather than less systemic support is needed for the potential of school autonomy to be realised"
605,Sibling placement and contact in out-of-home care,"Many children and young people do not live with all of their siblings in out-of-home care, and contact with the siblings who are not placed with them is not always regular or easily accessed, according to this report.

Summary
Children and young people in out-of-home care across Australia have told CREATE that living with their brothers and sisters in care is very important and that they are the people they most want to contact when they are not living together. Our latest research shows that many children and young people do not live with all of their siblings in out-of-home care, and contact with the siblings who are not placed with them is not always regular or easily accessed. This report sheds light on the experiences of children young people and caseworkers in each state and territory and what they think about this important issue"
606,Opportunities for information sharing: case studies,"Personal information provided to government and non-government service providers is highly sensitive. Appropriate collection, management and storage of personal information are critical elements to citizen trust in the public sector. However, misconceptions about the frameworks governing sharing personal information can impact on the coordination of services, case management and policy development.

&nbsp;

The NSW Department of Premier &amp; Cabinet engaged the Social Policy Research Centre to develop three case studies that identified the challenges to sharing information appropriately, and the opportunities for better personal information sharing between government agencies and non-government organisations. Improved sharing of personal information in these areas can support more effective policy development, leading to improved service delivery performance and coordination.

&nbsp;

The Social Policy Research Centre identified the legislative and policy framework for each case study, conducted qualitative research on the interpretation of this framework, and developed three case study reports"
607,Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People and dementia: a review of the research,"This report outlines the prevalence of dementia and modifiable risk factors in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.

Executive summary

The high rate of dementia in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities requires urgent attention. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people experience dementia at an earlier age then the general population and this, combined with the steadily growing number of older Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, will result in the number of people effected by&nbsp; dementia growing significantly in the coming years.

Although higher rates of dementia have been reported in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, the disease is often overlooked by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander&nbsp; communities, health workers and service providers. Geographical constraints in the provision of services, a lack of education and awareness in communities and by health workers and the prevalence of other chronic diseases have all posed considerable barriers to the recognition of dementia as an emerging health issue.


This paper includes the following recommendations to ensure that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, family members and communities have access to awareness, information, and appropriate support services for people with dementia"
608,Online dating and mating: the use of the internet to meet sexual partners,"Australia has experienced high growth in internet usage and online dating (OD) in recent years. OD is used for seeking romantic and sexual partners. Australia has also recently experienced increases in the incidence and prevalence of some sexually transmissible infections (STIs). Risk factors for STIs are related to sexual behaviour patterns. As such, understanding sexual behaviours, including those resulting from online dating, is of relevance to public health. Risk is a feature of modern society and the concept of risk relates to hazards that are assessed in relation to future possibilities and consequences.

This project examines the behaviours and experiences of people who use OD, and how they may or may not address risk in their use of online dating. Using a qualitative approach, fifteen people who use OD were interviewed online.

The findings reveal that online daters use a variety of methods for managing and understanding the risks they perceive to be associated with OD. Online daters compare the risks of online dating with other activities in their lives to justify their use of the medium. Many feel self-confident in their personal ability to manage and limit risks they might encounter. For some, the ability to be able to scape-goat risk (i.e. to blame others) is a method by which they can contextualise their own experiences and support their risk strategies. For many, the control offered by the online environment is central to risk management. Additionally, the social context in which an individual encounters a potential risk will shape how they perceive and experience the risk.

Online daters do consider the risks involved and they demonstrate personal autonomy in their risk management. From a public health perspective, it is important to understand how individuals experience risk, but it is imperative that interventions are implemented at a population level"
609,"Business set-up, transfer and closure","The report deals with the key drivers of business set-ups, transfers and closures. It considers innovative new business models and entrepreneurial activity.

It also examines a wide range of regulatory, institutional and financial factors that influence primarily set-ups, but ultimately can also impact on the manner and ease with which businesses close.

Finally, the report examines the closure of businesses - through voluntary exits, personal insolvency (bankruptcy) or corporate insolvency.

This report was released on 21 May 2015. You are invited to examine the draft report, to make written submissions by Friday 3 July 2015 and to register to participate in public hearings.

Key Points


	Businesses are set-up for a variety of reasons and in any one year there is a churn of entries and exits that is comparable with other countries. Most businesses are small and a very low proportion are innovative, producing a product or service new to Australian or international markets. The propensity to be innovative is highest amongst larger businesses.
	While it is generally relatively easy to start a business, a number of longstanding issues with specific regulatory requirements and regulator engagement and funding remain unaddressed and are making new business entry unnecessarily complex or costly.
	Some new business models - particularly those that exploit digital technology to make better use of information - are challenging existing regulatory arrangements or causing others to operate in regulatory grey areas. Regulators should have the capacity to exempt businesses for a fixed period, from particular regulatory requirements where these deter entry but exemption does not threaten consumer, public health and safety, or environmental outcomes.
	Government assistance to business set-ups should not be directed at particular business models, technologies, sectors or locations - criteria based on desired outcomes (such as technology transfer and spillovers) with matching private sector investment, are less likely to distort incentives and behaviours, particularly in a rapidly evolving environment. Any assistance should focus on those areas where there are economy-wide net benefits, and in the absence of a business set-up, there would be a justifiable need for other forms of government assistance.
	Access to finance is generally not a significant barrier to business set-up.
	
		New debt financing platforms, such as peer-to-peer lending, are helping to fill the gap in unsecured debt finance available from the major financial institutions. The voluntary participation by lenders in comprehensive credit reporting should be reviewed.
		A two-tier regulatory structure should be introduced for crowd-sourced equity to balance the financing needs of business against the risk preferences of different types of investors.
	
	
	Most businesses are closed or transferred without financial failure. Governments\u27 role in such situations should be limited to provision of clear guidelines for businesses, associations and advisers on exit and succession planning, and ensuring government processes are timely.
	While some specific reforms to Australia\u27s corporate insolvency regime are warranted, a wholesale change to the system, such as the adoption of the United States \u27chapter 11\u27 framework, is not justified.
	
		Formal restructuring of companies through voluntary administration should be enabled as an option for when a company may become, but is not yet, insolvent.
		There should be provision for a \u27safe harbour\u27 to allow company directors to explore restructuring options without liability for insolvent trading.
		A simplified liquidation process should be introduced to reduce the time and expense toward winding up businesses with little or no recoverable assets.
		All directors should be required to obtain a director identification number to enable the easier detection of disqualified or fraudulent directors.
	
	
	The default exclusion period and associated restrictions applying to bankrupts in relation to access to finance, employment (including being a company director) and overseas travel should be reduced from 3 years to 1 year, with the trustee and courts retaining the power to extend this period where necessary to prevent abuse of the bankruptcy process"
610,Decarbonizing development: three steps to a zero-carbon future,"This report lays out three steps for a smooth transition to a zero-carbon future and provides data, examples and policy advice to help countries makes the shift.

Overview

Getting to zero net emissions and stabilizing climate change starts with planning for the long-term future and not stopping at short-term goals. It means getting prices right as part of a broad policy package that can trigger changes in both investments and behaviors, and it requires smoothing the transition for those most affected.

A new World Bank report walks policymakers through those three steps with data, examples and policy advice to help put countries on a path to decarbonizing their development in a smooth and orderly way.

The solutions exist, and they are affordable – if governments take action today, the report says"
611,Commonwealth place-based service delivery initiatives: key learnings project,"Overview: Place-based initiatives are programs designed and delivered with the intention of targeting a specific geographical location and particular population group in order to respond to complex social problems. Typically, they focus on areas and communities with entrenched disadvantage or deprivation.

This report investigates the key factors and characteristics associated with successful outcomes with such programs, drawing on the international literature and evaluation studies of Australian government and overseas programs.

Key messages:


	Many Commonwealth place-based initiatives reviewed had features that accord with those of international place-based initiatives, including common program elements such as design, delivery, implementation and evaluation.
	Evaluation of all these common elements is rarely done by either international or Commonwealth place-based initiatives.
	In particular, evaluations of Commonwealth place-based initiatives lacked sufficient evidence to establish the causal effects of initiatives, their cost-effectiveness and an understanding of how these initiatives work to achieve their goals. This was more pronounced among the evaluation of Commonwealth initiatives than in international evaluations"
612,Talking it through: responses to sorcery and witchcraft beliefs and practices in Melanesia,"Provides insights both into how sorcery and witchcraft practices and beliefs are playing out in contemporary Melanesia, and also the types of interventions that are being trialled or debated to address the problems associated with them.

Introduction

This volume originates from two multidisciplinary conferences in 2013, one in Australia and one in Papua New Guinea, focusing on the negative social consequences of belief in sorcery and witchcraft in Melanesia. &nbsp;The volume brings together a selection of papers from both conferences, and although the majority concern PNG, two chapters deal with Solomon Islands and two with Vanuatu. While there are a number of similarities in the experiences of these three countries, and indeed within them, there are also crucial differences, especially in regard to the extent of violence associated with the beliefs.

613,Overview of Australian Indigenous health status 2014,"This Overview of Australian Indigenous health status provides information about: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations; the context of Indigenous health; various measures of population health status; selected health conditions; and health risk and protective factors.

This Overview of Australian Indigenous health status provides a comprehensive summary of the most recent indicators of the health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Australia (states and territories are: New South Wales (NSW), Victoria (Vic), Queensland (Qld), Western Australia (WA), South Australia (SA), Tasmania (Tas), The Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and The Northern Territory (NT)). It draws largely on previously published information, some of which has been re-analysed to provide clearer comparisons between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and non-Indigenous people (for more details of statistics and methods, readers should refer to the original sources). Very little information is available separately for Australian Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islander people. It is often difficult to determine whether original sources that use the term ‘Indigenous\u27 are referring to Aboriginal people only, Torres Strait Islander people only or to both groups. In these instances the terms from the original source are used"
614,Dealing with unemployment: what should be the role of labour market programs?,"This review presents a summary of evidence on outcomes from active labour market programs. Active&nbsp;labour market programs aim to increase the likelihood of employment for individuals who are&nbsp;unemployed or at risk of unemployment. The focus of this review is on studies of active labour market&nbsp;programs in Australia, supplemented with international evidence. An overview and historical background on active labour market programs is provided, as well as an introduction to the empirical&nbsp;methods used to estimate the effect of the programs.

Evidence on the effects of the main types of&nbsp;programs – case management, work experience programs and formal education and training – is&nbsp;reviewed, and the main findings are distilled into a set of lessons for policy makers. The review&nbsp;concludes that active labour market programs cannot by themselves have a major impact on the rate of&nbsp;unemployment, but some spending on these programs is justified by outcomes such as increasing the&nbsp;pool of unemployed who are job ready and sharing the burden of unemployment. Job search and wage&nbsp;subsidy programs are suggested to be good ways to assist unemployed who are less disadvantaged. For&nbsp;unemployed with higher levels of disadvantage, priority should be given to programs that create jobs&nbsp;with opportunities for linked training, and that provide a pathway to a permanent job.&nbsp;

615,Assessing the prison experience for Australian First Peoples: a prospective research approach,"The purpose of this paper is to conceptualise a decolonising prison quality research method that is respectful of and culturally sensitive to Australian First Peoples.

Abstract

Australian First Peoples hyperincarceration is concomitant with the trauma of historical and contemporary colonisation in perpetuating social dysfunction. Ongoing colonisation has been sustained by research that does not respect First Peoples epistemology, axiology, and ontology. Given this, the impact of prison quality and the potential association with First Peoples imprisonment and recidivism has been inadequately researched. Therefore there is a need to examine prison quality as experienced by Australian First Peoples. The purpose of this paper is to conceptualise a decolonising prison quality research method that is respectful of and culturally sensitive to Australian First Peoples. The proposed method interfaces First Peoples yarning with Appreciative Inquiry. Underpinning the proposed method is that all researchers, First Peoples or non-Indigenous, are attuned to cultural awareness and sensitive to the engagement process. When yarning is interfaced with Appreciative Inquiry and the latter is modified in consultation with First Peoples input, the proposed research method empowers research participants, potentially contributing to de-colonisation"
616,The Brimbank atlas of health and education,"Presents a detailed regional profile of the City of Brimbank, covering a range of health, education and other social and demographic characteristics.

Overview

This atlas, prepared by the&nbsp;Public Health Information Development Unit at The University of Adelaide for the Mitchell Institute, provides a range of information for decision-makers, planners, service providers, researchers and communities.

It is hoped its production will bring a better understanding of the complex interactions between individuals and families, their environments and social structures over a lifetime, and how these factors influence the health, education and ultimately, the flourishing of current and future generations of Brimbank residents.

In order to do this, a number of indicators have been chosen to describe different aspects of the population, and, by using them, to highlight differences, especially in health and education outcomes, across the community. The indicators have also been selected to cover the lifespan&nbsp;and&nbsp;offers a perspective on understanding inequalities across life and tracing outcomes at one stage of life, to the accumulation of experiences which occurred at earlier stages"
617,Lifestyle and embodied energy: A proposed hybrid analysis method for housing,"This thesis set out to form a bridge between the disciplines of architectural history, social and women’s history, building technology and environmental assessment, by investigating changes to existing houses over time and linking these with changes in lifestyle and technology.

Abstract

The primary aim of this research is to establish a Hybrid Analysis Method for Housing (HAMH) as a vehicle for the investigation of the relationship between the environmental impact of the building materials in a house and the lifestyle of its inhabitants, both immediately after construction and in the present day.

The HAMH incorporates both qualitative and quantitative analysis. The former relates to oral interviews with people who lived around the time the case study houses were first constructed, complemented by oral interviews covering the same questions with the present inhabitants of the case study houses. The quantitative part of the research is an investigation of the embodied energy of building materials invested in the case study houses since their construction"
618,NHMRC information paper: evidence on the effectiveness of homeopathy for treating health conditions,"This paper provides a summary of evidence from research on the effectiveness of homeopathy in treating health conditions in humans.

Findings

There was no reliable evidence from research in humans that homeopathy was effective for treating the range of health conditions considered: no good-quality, well-designed studies with enough participants for a meaningful result reported either that homeopathy caused greater health improvements than placebo, or caused health improvements equal to those of another treatment.

For some health conditions, studies reported that homeopathy was not more effective than placebo. For other health conditions, there were poor-quality studies that reported homeopathy was more effective than placebo, or as effective as another treatment. However, based on their limitations, those studies were not reliable for making conclusions about whether homeopathy was effective. For the remaining health conditions it was not possible to make any conclusion about whether homeopathy was effective or not, because there was not enough evidence.

Conclusions

Based on the assessment of the evidence of effectiveness of homeopathy, NHMRC concludes that there are no health conditions for which there is reliable evidence that homeopathy is effective.

Homeopathy should not be used to treat health conditions that are chronic, serious, or could become serious. People who choose homeopathy may put their health at risk if they reject or delay treatments for which there is good evidence for safety and effectiveness. People who are considering whether to use homeopathy should first get advice from a registered health practitioner. Those who use homeopathy should tell their health practitioner and should keep taking any prescribed treatments"
619,"Walk, talk, work: the importance of pedestrians and public space for collaboration in hospital knowledge precincts","EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

“All truly great thoughts are conceived while walking.” So said Friedrich Nietzsche, who wasn’t short on great thoughts.

While hospital knowledge precincts may not necessarily be the haunt of great philosophers, this research explores the importance of walkability in promoting ideas, innovation and collaboration.

It contends that providing high quality public spaces encourages people to walk around, through and beyond a precinct, enabling connections to be made between institutions and individuals, which will in turn lead to collaboration and innovation.

A hospital knowledge precinct can be defined as a distinct area of a city that has a concentration of clinical care facilities colocated with a university and bio-medical research facilities.

With significant growth in this type of cluster, and a reliance in metropolitan planning on these sites as employment and innovation centres, how have leading hospital knowledge precincts designed their physical connectivity to enable collaboration?

Through literature and website reviews, site visits, interviews, and mapping of building types and land uses, this study explores the public spaces and pedestrian networks of eight established or emerging hospital knowledge precincts in the US, UK, Canada, Sweden, France and Australia.

Three Elements of Connectivity 

Each of the precincts has its strengths, but one amongst them stands out, with vibrant public realm, a vision that clearly articulates what it wants to achieve in collaboration and innovation, and a regeneration program that reflects those aims.

While not without its challenges, the Manchester Corridor in the United Kingdom achieves a balance of the elements identified in the research as crucial to connectivity and collaboration:


	Proximity – a balance of proximity to related institutions (co-location) AND to other diverse activities (mixed use) gives people reasons to walk.
	Interaction – a range of opportunities for interaction, formal and informal, in a network of intersecting paths and gathering spaces allows incidental conversations and connections to occur.
	Quality – a network of places and links that look good, are safe, and comfortable encourages people to walk.


Trends 

The case studies uncover a number of trends that are significantly changing the form and function of hospital knowledge precincts:

1. Translational research buildings and clinical settings are internalising interaction. This is attractive from a workplace perspective, but not necessarily conducive to a collaborative precinct.

2. Buildings are getting bigger and taller, increasing the number of people on site significantly. This has positive implications for interaction, but the management of congestion and quality of public space become critical.

3. Centralised public spaces and circulation ‘spines’ (internal and external) are becoming a common design response to congestion. These provide opportunities for gathering, retail and other uses, but coupled with larger building footprints can lead to a loss of fine grain movement networks, making connectivity more difficult. They also provide opportunities for the de-institutionalisation of the hospitals with art and community activity.

4. The US precincts visited have their own member-based precinct planning bodies to oversee energy and transport initiatives, precinct and building development, and complex stakeholder issues and relationships. This is not replicated in other regions, but holds valuable lessons and potential for the design and management of public space in these types of precinct"
620,Negotiating healthy trade in Australia: health impact assessment of the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement,"Drawing on leaked texts of potential provisions of the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement, this health impact assessment found the potential for negative impacts in the cost of medicines, tobacco control policies, alcohol control policies, and food labeling.

Overview

The Centre for Health Equity Training Research and Evaluation (CHETRE) has been working with a group of Australian academics and non-government organisations interested in the health of the Australian population&nbsp;to carry out a health impact assessment (HIA) on the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP) negotiations.

In the absence of official publicly available drafts of the trade agreement, the health impact assessment drew on leaked texts of potential provisions and formulated policy scenarios based on high priority health policies that could be affected by the TPP. The HIA found the potential for negative impacts in each of the four areas under investigation: the cost of medicines; tobacco control policies; alcohol control policies; and food labeling.

In each of these areas, the HIA report traces the relevant proposed provisions through to their likely effects on the policy scenarios onto the likely impact on the health of Australians, focusing particularly on vulnerable groups in the Australian community.

The report makes a number of recommendations to DFAT regarding the TPP provisions and to the Australian Government regarding the TPP negotiating process"
621,"Acting early, changing lives: how prevention and early action saves money and improves wellbeing","Evidence indicates worsening or unacceptably high levels of problems amongst Australia’s children and young people. These problems will not improve – and could get worse – unless we are able to effectively intervene to prevent these problems from occurring in the first place or address the problems early before they become entrenched.

This report investigates the potential of early intervention to improve the outcomes of Australian children, especially those children experiencing significant levels of disadvantage, and especially for the long-term (i.e. into adolescence and adulthood).

Early intervention is defined in this report as interventions that occur during the early years of an individual’s life (0-5 years of age) in order to prevent a negative outcome or to address an existing problem.

The justification for early intervention (i.e. intervention during the early years) rests with the nature of human development and the way in which children develop and learn. The basic foundations for development are laid down during the early childhood years. The prenatal period also plays an important role in an individual’s longterm outcomes.&nbsp"
622,Evidence-based service modules for a sustained home visiting program,"The Centre for Community Child Health (CCCH) at the Murdoch Childrens Research Institute and the Royal Children’s Hospital has undertaken two literature reviews to inform the design of a sustained home visiting program for vulnerable families with young children; the program is now known as \u27right@home\u27. This project is being led by a collaboration between three organisations: The Australian Research Alliance for Children and Youth (ARACY), CCCH, and the University of New South Wales.

The first literature review undertaken by CCCH (Sustained home visiting for vulnerable families and children: A review of effective programs (McDonald et al., 2012) (hereon in referred to as the Home visiting review of effective programs) sought to answer the question ‘what works in home visiting programs?’ The conclusion reached was that it was not possible to answer the question definitively, either because the evidence regarding the ‘components’ of home visiting programs is contradictory or contested, or the evidence is not available.

As the home visiting review of effective programs focused on what was delivered (ie. the efficacy of different manualised programs), rather than how services were delivered (ie. the effect of the manner in which services were delivered and the nature of the relationships established between service providers and parents), a second literature review was undertaken: Sustained home visiting for vulnerable families and children: A literature review of effective processes and strategies (Moore et al., 2012) (hereon in referred to as the Home visiting review of effective processes and strategies).

The home visiting review of effective processes and strategies identified converging evidence from a number of sources to support the idea that the process aspects of service delivery matter for outcomes – how services are provided is as important as what is provided. A number of key elements of effective service delivery processes have been repeatedly identified in the research literature and these represent the threshold features or bedrock on which all services should be based: if services are not delivered in accordance with these process features, then efforts to change people’s behaviour will be less effective (Moore et al., 2012).

The evidence also indicated that the identification of goals, and of strategies to achieve these goals, needs to be done in partnership with parents. However, while the ultimate choice of strategies should be made by parents, the strategies on offer used must be evidence-based. Therefore, service providers should be able to draw on a suite of evidence-based strategies to address the range of challenges that parents face in caring for their children (Moore et al., 2012). In the light of the findings of this second literature review, it was decided that the right@home home visiting program would not involve the delivery of a manualised program. Rather, service delivery would be based on the processes of effective engagement and partnership, while the content of the program would take two forms: standard modules that are delivered to all participants, and e.g. information on the stages of child development), and evidence-based ‘service modules’ (i.e. specific strategies) that could be deployed to address issues that are of particular concern to individual parents.&nbsp;

623,Sustained home visiting for vulnerable families and children: a review of effective processes and strategies,"Parenting young children has become a more complex and stressful business, especially for those families in our community with the least resources (Grose, 2006; Hayes et al, 2010; Poole, 2004; Richardson &amp; Prior, 2005; Trask, 2010). A widening gap exists between families that function well and those that are vulnerable. The paradox of service delivery for children and families is that vulnerable families – that is, those families with the greatest needs – are also the least likely to be able to access those services (Ghate &amp; Hazel, 2002; Fram, 2003). A range of barriers exist for vulnerable and at risk families in making use of services (Carbone et al, 2004).

One of the key barriers to vulnerable families accessing services is that many find it difficult to relate to the formal service system and are easily alienated by practices others find acceptable. Research regarding parents’ experiences of support services suggests that parents want services where they are simultaneously cared for and enabled in their role as parents, and to receive services characterised by empathy, competence, functionality, respect, flexibility and honesty (Attride-Stirling et al, 2001; Winkworth et al, 2009). Vulnerable parents fear a loss of autonomy in their interactions with support services and want services that are non-judgemental and that provide continuity of care (Ghate &amp; Hazel, 2002; von Bultzingslowen, 2006).

In addition to the barriers faced by vulnerable and marginalised families in accessing services, the system does not work in an integrated or coherent fashion to ensure that all children and families needing support receive it. Furthermore, the vast majority of services for children and families in Australia do not have an outreach function, that is, a means of engaging these vulnerable and at risk families who are in need of support but use services inconsistently or not at all. In short, the service system was not designed to meet the needs of vulnerable families within the context of a rapidly changing social and economic climate. Therefore, many families requiring support are not receiving it.

624,Place-based approaches to child and family services,"This paper synthesizes the conceptual and empirical literature on place-based approaches to meeting the needs of young children and their families. A specific focus of the paper is on the potential contribution of place-based approaches to service reconfiguration and coordination.

Outline

The paper begins by outlining the sweeping social changes that have occurred in developed nations over the past few decades and their impact on children, families and communities. It explores the ‘joined up’ problems faced by families and communities in the contemporary world, and highlights the need to reconfigure services to support families more effectively. The paper then focuses on ‘joined up’ solutions, on what we know about how to meet the challenges posed by the complex problems that characterise our society. Next, the paper explores what a place-based approach involves, and what role it can play in supporting families with young children.

The rationale underpinning place-based approaches is outlined and the evidence for the effectiveness of the approach is summarised. The paper then looks at what can be learned from efforts to implement place-based initiatives in Australia and overseas, and explores the issues that need to be addressed in implementing this strategy. The ways in which the early childhood service system might be reconfigured are also considered, and the paper ends with a consideration of the policy and implementation implications.&nbsp"
625,DEECD Early Childhood Intervention Reform Project,"This literature review was commissioned by the Office for Children and Early Childhood Development, Department of Education and Early Childhood Development (DEECD), as part of its Early Childhood Intervention Services (ECIS) Reform Project (Stage 2): Developing Options and Next Steps. This Project aims to significantly enhance the efficiency, effectiveness and sustainability of Victoria’s ECIS system and improve outcomes for children with a disability or developmental delay and their families.

Early childhood intervention services (ECIS) support children with a disability or developmental delay from birth to school entry and their families. ECIS provides special education, therapy, counselling, service planning and coordination, assistance and support to access services such as kindergarten and child care. The services funded through DEECD are provided by government Specialist Children\u27s Services teams and non-government Early Childhood Intervention agencies. In addition to the services provided by ECIS teams and agencies, the state and federal governments fund a range of complementary programs to support young children with developmental disabilities and their families. These include initiatives to support families (My Time parent groups, Family Support Packages), services to support inclusion (Preschool Field Officers, Inclusion Support Facilitators), and funding to support particular disability groups (Helping Children with Autism packages). These additional services and supports, together with the ECIS teams and agencies, make up the totality of early childhood intervention provision for young children with disabilities.

The focus of the literature review is research on contemporary Australian and international evidence-based service delivery models for children with a disability, developmental delay or additional needs aged 0-8 years"

The project approach is informed by research and evidence, recognising the multiple and multi-level influences on children’s development and the need to support the role of communities in improving outcomes for children.

The review of the evidence base, undertaken by the Centre for Community Child Health in collaboration with the Royal Children’s Hospital Education Institute, begins by outlining the changing social and environmental conditions and the influence of these changes on vulnerable children and families. The report then discusses actions undertaken to address these challenges and the reasons why these actions have failed. Next, key factors enabling optimal outcomes for children and contemporary Australian and international evidence-based interventions and approaches that support vulnerable children are examined. The review concludes by summarising the research on the financial and social costs of doing nothing to intervene and improve outcomes for children.

In summary, the review endorses the development of a place-based approach with a number of key strategies that simultaneously address families’ immediate needs for support (the foreground factors) and the broader conditions under which families are raising young children (the background factors). The approach needs to promote wrap around, integrated services that are responsive to and driven by the community. Focus must also be given to how services are delivered rather than what is delivered. In order to implement the approach, it is critical that a robust governance structure or entity capable of coordinating and supporting the many stakeholders and services involved is established and a long-term financial and policy commitment is made.

Key messages encapsulating broad themes from the literature, supported by concluding statements, have been developed to enable clear communication to a variety of audiences.&nbsp"
627,The hidden harm: alcohol’s impact on children and families,"Examines the prevalence and effects of heavy drinking on families and children, and the extent to which they persisted or changed over time.

Summary

The 2015 study examined the prevalence and effects of heavy drinking on families and children, and the extent to which they persisted or changed over time.

It paints a concerning picture of the prevalence of alcohol-related family and domestic violence in Australia, shedding new light on a hidden dimension of alcohol harms that occurs largely behind closed doors.

Key findings

The hidden harm draws on two national surveys of alcohol’s harm to others, service system data and qualitative interviews with families, providing for the first time a detailed and valuable insight into the magnitude of the problem and the large numbers of Australian children who are being put at risk.


	In 2011 there were 29,684 police-reported incidents of alcohol-related domestic violence in Australia, and that’s just in the four states and territories where this data is available.
	Children are being verbally abused, left in unsupervised or unsafe situations, physically hurt or exposed to domestic violence because of others’ drinking. Many were also witnessing verbal or physical conflict, drinking or inappropriate behaviour.
	Over a million children (22 per cent of all Australian children) are estimated to be affected in some way by the drinking of others (2008). 142,582 children were substantially affected (2008), and more than 10,000 Australian children are in the child protection system because of a carers drinking (2006-07)"
628,Information paper: evidence on wind farms and human health,"This Information Paper provides Australians with a summary of the evidence on possible health effects of wind farms in humans and explains how NHMRC developed its summary based on the findings of independent reviews of the evidence. It is intended for use by any person or group interested in wind farms.

Wind farms in Australia 

Wind turbines use rotating blades attached to towers to convert wind energy into electricity. A group of wind turbines is known as a wind farm and may be located on land or offshore. Wind turbine design has evolved over the last 20 years to enable better harnessing of wind energy.

Wind farms have been promoted as a viable and sustainable alternative to traditional, non-renewable forms of energy production. Since the introduction of the Renewable Energy Act 2000, the number of wind farms in Australia has grown substantially. At the end of 2013, there were 68 wind farms across the country and more were being constructed or planned.

Why NHMRC is conducting this work 

NHMRC is responsible for ensuring that Australians receive the best available, evidence-based advice on matters relating to improving health and to preventing, diagnosing and treating disease. Concern about the effects on health from living near a wind farm has been expressed by some members of the community. Therefore, NHMRC examined the evidence on health effects associated with exposure to specific emissions from wind farms — noise, shadow flicker and electromagnetic radiation.

The current investigation of the potential health effects of wind farms builds upon NHMRC’s previous work in this area. In 2010, NHMRC’s Public statement: Wind turbines and health was published, with supporting evidence from Wind turbines and health: A rapid review of the evidence. The 2010 NHMRC Public Statement concluded that there “is currently no published scientific evidence to positively link wind turbines with adverse health effects”. Due to the limited amount of published scientific literature, NHMRC committed to carrying out a more extensive search for evidence.

This Information Paper provides an update to NHMRC’s previous work in this area. It is based on a comprehensive review of the available scientific evidence following well-established systematic review principles, which provide the most rigorous process for identifying and critically appraising evidence.

In Australia, responsibility for regulating the planning, development and operation of wind farms lies with state, territory and local governments. The outcomes of NHMRC’s review may assist these organisations to make decisions about the regulation of wind farms.

NHMRC’s review of the evidence will enable well-designed and targeted research to be undertaken in areas that have been identified as gaps in the evidence base"

Introduction


This paper surveys previous work on voluntary information disclosures in accounting reports of Australian Not-for-Profit organisations (NFPs). This is new research and is a part of a
project to evolve a comprehensive explanation of why Australian NFPs disclose what they do disclose; and to capture and explain patterns of variations between NFPs between what they regard to disclose and the type of information they disclose. To accomplish this, first some background information about the NFP sector are considered. Then, the Australian NFP sector is reviewed. Third, the information needs of some key stakeholders are briefly discussed. Next, the research methodology where a literature survey which looks at not just disclosures to NFPs but to the commercial sector that are plausibly

631,"Rogue NGOs and NPOs: content, context, consequences","This paper explores the key components of dysfunctional, criminal and deviant behaviours within and by associational and not-for-profit organisations, and their consequences in terms of practice, application and policy.

Abstract

This short primer explores the key components of dysfunctional, criminal and deviant behaviors within and by associational and not-for-profit organizations, and their consequences in terms of practice, application and policy. A rich literature review of major and minor nonprofit scandals—primarily in the West—but also in other countries around the world demonstrate the breadth and depth of nonprofit corruption, fraud and misuse of funds as well as misconduct and deviant behavior by individuals within and by organizations. These associations range from Mom and Pop-scaled voluntary foundations to transnational charitable organizations, and so-called “Dark Nonprofit Groups (DNGs)” that promote terrorism, hate, extreme political views and other noxious or bizarre ideologies. Summarized are the widely researched concerns regarding self-regulation of these organizations including weaknesses in management controls, issues with adherence to existing vision and mission statements; board and management accountability; internal and external fiduciary controls; and intra- and inter-governmental regulatory responses. The context of these wrongdoings are ensconced within the framework of a discussion of ethics, morals, and wayward interpretations of legal and ownership structures in prevailing cultures and societies. Consequences of nonprofit organizational misconduct and dysfunction reveal a universal need for more research into the dark side of the Third Sector; and additional accountability and transparency not only at the micro level—individuals and board members within the organization--but also at the state, federal and global level. Lastly, increasingly vocal activism of civil society is acknowledged to have given shape and direction to the new moral landscape of 21st century Third Sector agendas"
632,Is fat the sixth taste primary? Evidence and implications,"Explores our tongue\u27s ability to detect fat as a distinct taste similar to our ability to sense sweet, sour, bitter, acid and savory.

Abstract
Taste is the chemical sense responsible for the detection of non-volatile chemicals in potential foods. For fat to be considered as one of the taste primaries in humans, certain criteria must be met including class of affective stimuli, receptors specific for the class of stimuli on taste bud cells (TBC), afferent fibres from TBC to taste-processing regions of the brain, perception independent of other taste qualities and downstream physiological effects. The breakdown products of the macronutrients carbohydrates (sugars) and proteins (amino acids) are responsible for the activation of sweet and umami tastes, respectively. Following the same logic, the breakdown products of fat being fatty acids are the likely class of stimuli for fat taste. Indeed, psychophysical studies have confirmed that fatty acids of varying chain length and saturation are orally detectable by humans. The most likely fatty acid receptor candidates located on TBC are CD36 and G protein-coupled receptor 120. Once the receptors are activated by fatty acids, a series of transduction events occurs causing the release of neurotransmitters towards afferent fibres signalling the brain. Whether fatty acids elicit any direct perception independent of other taste qualities is still open to debate with only poorly defined perceptions for fatty acids reported. Others suggest that the fatty acid taste component is at detection threshold only and any perceptions are associated with either aroma or chemesthesis. It has also been established that oral exposure to fat via sham feeding stimulates increases in blood TAG concentrations in humans. Therefore, overall, with the exception of an independent perception, there is consistent emerging evidence that fat is the sixth taste primary. The implications of fatty acid taste go further into health and obesity research, with the gustatory detection of fats and their contributions to energy and fat intake receiving increasing attention. There appears to be a coordinated bodily response to fatty acids throughout the alimentary canal; those who are insensitive orally are also insensitive in the gastrointestinal tract and overconsume fatty food and energy. The likely mechanism linking fatty acid taste insensitivity with overweight and obesity is development of satiety after consumption of fatty foods"
633,The evidence: what we know about place-based approaches to support children’s wellbeing,"The evidence summary begins by considering the importance of place. This leads to a discussion of why different approaches to services and service delivery are required, including a brief description of recent changes in the conditions in which families are raising young children and the complex social problems we face. Consideration is given to defining place-based approaches and their evolution in Australia, citing examples from the United States (US), United Kingdom (UK), Canada and Australia.

Key features and dimensions of place-based approaches explores the key features of place-based approaches in more depth and examines how the various Australian initiatives incorporate them into their models. The evidence of efficacy for place- based approaches is then reviewed, focusing on building community and interagency partnerships and place-based action planning and intervention.

What evidence is missing? focuses on gaps in our knowledge and what we still need to learn about establishing collaborative partnerships and successfully implementing place-based interventions. The final section wraps up what we know about the key elements of place-based approaches.

The evidence summary concludes that we are still at a relatively early stage of implementing place-based initiatives, and argues that none of the current Australian initiatives have incorporated all the key features.

This publication has been developed by the Centre for Community Child Health at the Murdoch Childrens Research Institute and The Royal Children’s Hospital as part of the Collaborate for children: scoping project funded by the Australian Government Department of Education. It summarises the evidence on what we know and are still yet to learn about place-based approaches to improve children’s outcomes.

Over 12 months, the project investigated the Australian place-based landscape to understand how we can better promote children’s wellbeing through place-based initiatives. This publication is one of four key reports produced through the project. The reports are:

635,National outcome measures for early childhood development—phase 2: scoping paper,"This report presents the results of Phase 2 of the National Outcome Measures for Early Childhood Development project. It identifies potential indicators for 5 indicator topic areas (child behavioural problems, peer relationships, racism, school engagement and parenting quality/capacity).

Summary

This report constitutes Phase 2 of the National Outcome Measures for Early Childhood Development project. Developing an indicator-based reporting framework for early childhood development will enable monitoring of achievements against the Early Childhood Development Outcomes Framework outlined in the National Early Childhood Development Strategy, Investing in the early years (the ECD Strategy), released by the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) in July 2009.

The ECD Strategy is designed to guide Australia\u27s comprehensive response to evidence about the importance of early childhood development, and the benefits-and cost- effectiveness-of ensuring that all children experience a positive early childhood from before birth through the first 8 years of life.

Phase 1 of the National Outcome Measures for Early Childhood Development project recommended 20 indicator topic areas for reporting against the Early Childhood Development Outcomes Framework included in the ECD Strategy. Indicators with data sources were recommended for 13 of the 20 topic areas. This work was published in the report National outcome measures for early childhood development: development of an indicator- based reporting framework (AIHW 2011b).

The main focus of Phase 2 was to review potential indicators and/or data sources for the remaining 7 topic areas that required additional work at the end of Phase 1. Five topic areas required indicator development (child behavioural problems, peer relationships, cultural appropriateness, school engagement and parenting quality/capacity) and 2 topic areas required investigation of potential data sources (social and emotional wellbeing, and family social networks).

Forty potential indicators have been put forward in this report as being conceptually suitable across the 5 topic areas that required indicator development. There are 8 indicators with available data sources across 4 of the 5 topic areas. However, for the \u27school engagement\u27 topic area, none of the indicators discussed have an available data source.

Further consideration should be given as to whether the 8 indicators with available data are the most appropriate for the constructs measured, whether options should be explored for incorporating identified indicators with no available data source into existing surveys, or whether a new national early child development survey should be established to collect the necessary data for reporting against the Early Childhood Development Outcomes Framework.

For the 2 topic areas requiring investigation of data availability-\u27social and emotional wellbeing\u27 and \u27family social networks\u27-suitable data should become available during 2015"
636,Smoking cessation and tobacco prevention in Indigenous populations,"This article systematically reviews 91 smoking cessation and tobacco prevention studies tailored for Indigenous populations around the world, with a particular focus on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations in Australia. We identified several components of effective interventions, including the use of multifaceted programs that simultaneously address the behavioural, psychological and biochemical aspects of addiction, using resources culturally tailored for the needs of individual Indigenous populations.

Pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation was effective when combined with culturally tailored behavioural interventions and health professional support, though it is generally underused in clinical practice. From a policy perspective, interventions of greater intensity, with more components, were more likely to be effective than those of lower intensity and shorter duration. For any new policy it is important to consider community capacity building, development of knowledge, and sustainability of the policy beyond guided implementation.

Future research should address how the intervention can be supported into standard practice, policy, or translation into the front-line of clinical care. Investigations are also required to determine the efficacy of emerging therapies (such as e-cigarettes and the use of social media to tackle youth smoking), and under-researched interventions that hold promise based on non-Indigenous studies, such as the use of Champix. We conclude that more methodologically rigorous investigations are required to determine components of the less-successful interventions to aid future policy, practice and research initiatives.

637,"Lawyer availability and population change in regional, rural and remote areas of New South Wales","Executive summary

Over recent years, there has been popular concern about an apparent decrease in lawyers working in regional, rural and remote (RRR) areas throughout Australia. Attention has centred on perceived problems in the recruitment and retention of lawyers.

This research is the second of two studies undertaken by the Law and Justice Foundation into the availability of solicitors in RRR New South Wales (NSW). Both studies have included assessments of problems relating to the recruitment and retention of solicitors in different parts of NSW. The aim of both studies was to understand the nature of the problem to better inform strategies to improve access to lawyers for disadvantaged people in RRR areas.

The Foundation’s earlier study, Recruitment and retention of lawyers in regional, rural and remote New South Wales (Forell, Cain &amp; Gray 2010) produced findings, not all of which were consistent with the widely held perceptions. Key findings of that research included:


	Contrary to expectations, only a low seven per cent of public legal assistance solicitor positions in NSW were vacant on the census date. However, in some remote areas:
	vacancy rates were higher
	there were substantial levels of public legal service positions occupied by ‘non-incumbent’ solicitors, which suggested difficulties in filling positions substantively
	the time that public legal solicitors served in remote positions was low, and suggested more frequent staff turnover.
	The more remote the region, the greater the ratio of residents to solicitors (i.e. fewer solicitors per thousand residents).
	Remote areas were more likely to have few, if any, solicitors. In addition, remote areas were more likely to have the youngest and least experienced solicitors (outside of Sydney).
	Some areas, for example the Far West, had particular challenges in recruiting and retaining solicitors, while other regions did not experience such difficulties"
638,"Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders: current issues in awareness, prevention and intervention","This paper reviews the research and current policy surrounding prenatal alcohol exposure and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Alcohol use during pregnancy is linked to a spectrum of adverse fetal outcomes. This spectrum of abnormalities is collectively termed fetal alcohol spectrum disorders and may include physical, cognitive and/or developmental symptoms. The aim of this paper is to inform practitioners and other professionals working in a range of fields about the implications of FASD for children and their families. Current research on interventions or programs to work with families affected by FASD is also explored.

Key messages





	Prenatal alcohol exposure can cause a range of cognitive and physical abnormalities in embryos that can lead to impairments in a range of functions: sensory systems, language and communication, processing pace, learning and memory, abstract thinking, and executive functioning.





	Misunderstanding and labelling of those with FASD can lead to a poor self-concept, disrupted peer relationships, fractured educational and placement experiences and contact with youth justice services.





	The prevalence of FASD is likely to be underestimated by current measures. Certain populations, including children in out-of-home care and children in contact with youth justice services are thought to include an over-representation of individuals living with an undetected FASD.





	Tackling FASD requires focused and coordinated multidisciplinary and cross sector approaches. More information about the prevalence and nature of FASD will allow for improved service planning and implementation.





	Policy directions are needed that prioritise the screening and prevention of FASD in the community.





	Current and future professionals, including those in traditionally adult-focused services, need awareness and knowledge about the significance of FASD and prenatal alcohol exposure on children\u27s lives"
639,"Equality, capacity and disability in Commonwealth laws: final report","This report makes 55 recommendations for reforms intended to better provide people with disability equal recognition before the law, particularly in relation to the right to make decisions that affect their lives and to have those decisions respected.

Overview

This Inquiry is about ensuring people with disability have an equal right to make decisions for themselves. It is about respecting people’s dignity, autonomy and independence, while supporting them to make their own decisions, where such support is needed. This reflects an important movement away from:

viewing persons with disabilities as ‘objects’ of charity, medical treatment and social protection towards viewing persons with disabilities as ‘subjects’ with rights, who are capable of claiming those rights and making decisions for their lives based on their free and informed consent as well as being active members of society. 

The Inquiry commenced in July 2013, the same month in which a pilot of the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) in Australia was initiated, representing ‘a new way of providing community linking and individualised support for people with permanent and significant disability, their families and carers’. The objective of the NDIS is to provide persons with disability with greater choice and control over the disability services and support they receive.

The Terms of Reference required the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) to consider ‘how maximising individual autonomy and independence could be modelled in Commonwealth laws and legal frameworks’. The ALRC considers this can best be achieved by setting out principles and guidelines that can be used as a template for specific reforms. These principles and guidelines can be applied to Commonwealth and state and territory laws—in particular, guardianship and administration laws"
640,Counting the costs of crime in Australia: a 2011 estimate,"This report estimates the costs of crime for the calendar year 2011.

Executive summary

This report seeks to estimate how much crime costs the Australian economy by calculating the number of crimes that come to the attention of the authorities and, using crime victimisation survey data, the number of crimes that are not recorded officially. A dollar figure is then calculated for each estimated crime event and an indication given of the total cost of each specific crime type in terms of actual loss, intangible losses, loss of output caused through the criminal conduct and other related costs such as medical expenses, where relevant. Added to these costs are the costs of preventing and responding to crime in the community including the costs of maintaining the criminal justice system agencies of police, prosecution, courts and correctional agencies, as well as a proportion of the costs of Australian and state and territory government agencies that have crime-related functions. Finally, a deduction is made for the value of property recovered in the case of property crime, as well as the amount of funds recovered from criminals under federal, state and territory proceeds of crime legislation. More detailed information about how each of these estimates was derived is provided in the main body of the report.

Official attention paid to specific crime types, particularly drug-related crime and organised crime, affects both the reporting rate and also the cost of policing and correctional responses. In this sense, individual crime type costs and prevention and response costs are not mutually exclusive. Arguably, as individual crime types attract more attention, reporting rates increase and prevention and control of the crimes in question are seen as being deserving of increased resource"
641,Indigenous youth justice programs evaluation,"In this report, four programs that were already being implemented by states and territories and identified by them under the National Indigenous Law &amp; Justice Framework as promising practice in diversion are examined.

Executive summary

Diversion from the youth justice system is a critical goal for addressing the overrepresentation of Indigenous young people in the criminal justice system. In this report, four programs that were already being implemented by states and territories and identified by them under the National Indigenous Law &amp; Justice Framework as promising practice in diversion are examined. The programs were evaluated, as part of a broader initiative, to determine whether and on what basis they represent good practice (ie are supported by evidence). State and territory governments nominated the programs for evaluation.

The four programs sit at different points along a continuum, ranging from prevention (addressing known risk factors for offending behaviour, such as disengagement from family, school, community or culture), early intervention (with identified at-risk young people), diversion (diverting from court process—usually for first or second time offenders) and tertiary intervention (treatment to prevent recidivism):

• Aboriginal Power Cup (South Australia)—a sports-based program for engaging Indigenous young people in education and providing positive
role models (prevention).
• Tiwi Islands Youth Development and Diversion Unit (Northern Territory)—a diversion program that engages Tiwi youth who are at risk of entering the criminal justice system in prevention activities, such as a youth justice conference, school, cultural activities, sport and recreation (early intervention and diversion).
• Woorabinda Early Intervention Panel Coordination Service (Queensland)—a program to assess needs and make referrals for young Indigenous people and their families who are at risk or have offended and have complex needs (early intervention and diversion).
• Aggression Replacement Training (Queensland)—a 10 week group cognitivebehavioural program to control anger and develop pro-social skills, delivered to Indigenous and non-Indigenous youth assessed as ‘at risk’ of offending or reoffending (early intervention and tertiary intervention with offenders to reduce risk of reoffending).

For each program, the evaluation team developed a ‘program logic’, identifying the activities and goals of the program, and how it articulates within a broader framework of criminal justice prevention. This informed the design of the evaluation and the approach to collecting both qualitative data (from young people participating in the program, program staff, family, or other service providers/community members) and quantitative data to identify any effects of the program on individuals, or the broader community"
642,Learning leaders matter,"Learning leaders position themselves first as learners, then as leaders of other learners. The inherent tensions in this duality are explored in this literature review. Drawing on a broad range of research from education, psychology and neuroscience, the review builds a picture of the situation facing school principals, as leaders of learning communities.

The review is directed towards illustrating the professional practice of Developing Self and Others in the Australian Professional Standard for Principals, and focuses on how this practice is demonstrated in the experience of learning leaders.

The discussion clarifies key terminology and highlights how leaders need to understand the role of emotions, relationships, attachment behaviours, and collaboration in creating effective and sustainable learning communities.

&nbsp;Key issues arising from the literature review include the fact that there is no accepted standard for developing either self or others in the literature. Another is that the idea of developing self or others in a vacuum is becoming increasingly challenged with the realisation that all learning is context specific and interdependent. Finally, an area of considerable dispute in the literature concerns a divide between sociological and psychological standpoints on the role of leader. There is an opportunity for the academy to engage more directly in translating good research into practical orientations that cover the field from a practitioner point of view. The annotated bibliography includes resources from both standpoints"
643,A culture of trust enhances performance,"This literature review addresses and informs the hypothesis that ‘a culture of trust enhances performance’ in schools. Drawing on an environmental scan of research and policy literature, the authors explore the definition of trust and the ways in which trust is linked to performance in schools and organisations more broadly. The review synthesises literature exploring the relationships between trust and various measures of school improvement. It also offers a discussion of the relationship between trust and school governance.

The review concludes that there is ample evidence to support the hypothesis that ‘a culture of trust enhances performance in schools’. It notes that while there is surprisingly little research in the Australian setting, the evidence summarised in the review is international in scope and there is no reason why it ought not to apply to Australia.

The authors note that trust does not stand alone as a discrete capacity, rather it is the lifeblood of success in virtually every structure and process that involves the principal and other school leaders. Also, while a key finding is that the quality of relationships is central to the creation of trust, the extent of that quality is influenced by many factors, including the competence of the leader: trust will be lost very quickly if a leader is perceived to be incompetent. It is therefore important to build strength in and draw on intellectual or professional capital in establishing relational trust"
644,Student-centred schools make the difference,"The primary focus of this review is on how school leaders can develop and sustain a student-centred philosophy at all levels within their schools in order to increase the quality of education for all students. The authors draw on research literature from Australia and internationally to examine the impact that student-centred education can have on student outcomes, particularly for those students in disadvantaged contexts.

The review initially explores the concept of student-centred schools and how this notion is nested within a range of theoretical and philosophical constructs. The authors draw from research into student-centred pedagogy, learner-centred education, student-centred teaching and learning, and student-centred/ learner-centred leadership to provide a description of a student-centred school. They then consider models of leading student-centred schools, drawing from AITSL’s Australian Professional Standard for Principals and looking at the large-scale student-centred reforms in Ontario, Canada.

The authors use Viviane Robinson’s five dimensions of school leadership that impact on student outcomes: 1) Establishing goals and expectations, 2) Resourcing strategically, 3) Ensuring quality teaching, 4) Leading teacher learning and development, and 5) Ensuring a safe and orderly environment.&nbsp; They then extend this framework to include three additional dimensions of student-centred schooling that emerged from the literature: a) Working with the wider community, b) Ethical Leadership, and c) Student voice. This report offers a critical review of literature to address the hypothesis that student-centred schools make the difference"

Summary

This report sets out the findings of research into domestic and family violence (DFV) prevention initiatives focused on groups and communities identified as being at greater risk of experiencing DFV and/or having difficulty accessing support services.

647,Effective strategies to strengthen the mental health and wellbeing of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people,"Introduction: The purpose of this paper is to draw on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (Indigenous) perspectives, theoretical understandings, and available evidence to answer questions about what is required to effectively address Indigenous people’s mental health and social and emotional wellbeing.

Social and emotional wellbeing is a multifaceted concept. Although the term is often used to describe issues of ‘mental health’ and ‘mental illness’, it has a broader scope in that Indigenous culture takes a holistic view of health. It recognises the importance of connection to land, culture, spirituality, ancestry, family and community, how these connections have been shaped across generations, and the processes by which they affect individual wellbeing. It is a whole-of-life view, and it includes the interdependent relationships between families, communities, land, sea and spirit and the cyclical concept of life–death–life. Importantly, these concepts and understandings of maintaining and restoring health and social and emotional wellbeing differ markedly to those in many non-Indigenous-specific (or mainstream) programs that tend to emphasise an individual’s behavioural and emotional strengths and ability to adapt and cope with the challenges of life.

This paper explores the central question of ‘what are culturally appropriate mental health and social and emotional wellbeing programs and services for Indigenous people, and how are these best delivered?’. It identifies Indigenous perspectives of what is required for service provision and program delivery that align with Indigenous beliefs, values, needs and priorities. It explores the evidence and consensus around the principles of best practice in Indigenous mental health programs and services. It discusses these principles of best practice with examples of programs and research that show how these values and perspectives can be achieved in program design and delivery.

This paper seeks to provide an evidence-based, theoretically coherent discussion of the factors that influence the effective development, implementation and outcomes of initiatives to address Indigenous mental health and wellbeing issues. It seeks to assess whether the current investment in Indigenous people’s mental health is aligned with available evidence on what works. To this end, the paper reviews Australian literature and government health, mental health and social and emotional wellbeing policies and programs. The scope of programs and their criteria for inclusion in this paper are informed by the Key Result Area 4, Social and Emotional Wellbeing objectives, within the National Strategic Framework for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health 2003–13: Australian Government Implementation Plan 2007–2013.

This paper acknowledges the holistic nature of health, mental health and wellbeing, and the effects of Australia’s colonial history and legacy on the contemporary state of Indigenous social and emotional wellbeing. It recognises that there is a complex relationship between social and emotional wellbeing, harmful substance misuse, suicide, and a range of social and economic factors. Although this paper encompasses the broad priorities identified within the key Indigenous mental health policies and frameworks, it does not provide a detailed discussion of programs and resources that, although relevant here, are covered in a number of existing Closing the Gap Clearinghouse resource sheets and issues papers (see Appendix 1). These interweavings and overlaps are not surprising given the complexity and interconnectedness of the issues and determinants that are being addressed to strengthen Indigenous mental health and wellbeing"

649,Locomotion in extinct giant kangaroos: were sthenurines hop-less monsters?,"The extinct \u27sthenurine\u27 family of giant Kangaroos, up to three times larger than living Kangaroos, were able to walk on two feet, according to new research.

Abstract
Sthenurine kangaroos (Marsupialia, Diprotodontia, Macropodoidea) were an extinct subfamily within the family Macropodidae (kangaroos and rat-kangaroos). These “short-faced browsers” first appeared in the middle Miocene, and radiated in the Plio-Pleistocene into a diversity of mostly large-bodied forms, more robust than extant forms in their build. The largest (Procoptodon goliah) had an estimated body mass of 240 kg, almost three times the size of the largest living kangaroos, and there is speculation whether a kangaroo of this size would be biomechanically capable of hopping locomotion. Previously described aspects of sthenurine anatomy (specialized forelimbs, rigid lumbar spine) would limit their ability to perform the characteristic kangaroo pentapedal walking (using the tail as a fifth limb), an essential gait at slower speeds as slow hopping is energetically unfeasible. Analysis of limb bone measurements of sthenurines in comparison with extant macropodoids shows a number of anatomical differences, especially in the large species. The scaling of long bone robusticity indicates that sthenurines are following the “normal” allometric trend for macropodoids, while the large extant kangaroos are relatively gracile. Other morphological differences are indicative of adaptations for a novel type of locomotor behavior in sthenurines: they lacked many specialized features for rapid hopping, and they also had anatomy indicative of supporting their body with an upright trunk (e.g., dorsally tipped ischiae), and of supporting their weight on one leg at a time (e.g., larger hips and knees, stabilized ankle joint). We propose that sthenurines adopted a bipedal striding gait (a gait occasionally observed in extant tree-kangaroos): in the smaller and earlier forms, this gait may have been employed as an alternative to pentapedal locomotion at slower speeds, while in the larger Pleistocene forms this gait may have enabled them to evolve to body sizes where hopping was no longer a feasible form of more rapid locomotion"
650,Impacts of climate change on public health in Australia,"Provides information, opinions and recommendations relevant to assessing the potential impacts of climate change on public health in Australia, as well as guidelines for decision-making in responding to these impacts.

It aims to:


	draw attention to the potential impacts of climate change on health in Australia;
	discuss the policies and issues related to the impacts of climate change on health;
	present prioritised recommendations to decision-makers on policies and practices which may assist mitigation of and adaptation to the most serious of the identified impacts;
	provide guidance which will assist appropriate people and agencies to allocate resources to the highest priority problems; and
	provide a comprehensive list of references which provide reliable evidence about the potential impacts of climate change on health in Australia.


The immediate and longer-term impacts of climate change have the potential to affect Australian health and social environments seriously, and as such, demand and deserve attention by Federal and State Governments and agencies within the Australian public health sector.

Policymakers are faced with pressing issues of funding and delivering health services for an ageing society with an ever increasing burden of chronic disease and expectations of access to high-technology, high cost interventions. However, the impacts of future climate change on public health may potentially generate very large healthcare costs if current strategies for healthcare are inadequate.

Successful advocacy of new policies and practices by credible and influential groups must use language which can be understood by the people who are to be influenced. This advocacy must be supported by reliable evidence.

Climate-related catastrophes (droughts, floods, cyclones, other storms, bush fires) occur frequently in Australia. The demonstrably high variability in the incidence and severity of such phenomena present a challenge to scientists to discover and demonstrate any correlations between the catastrophes and the slow changes of climatic indices due to climate change.

Public health organisations must start to develop alternative, more effective, practices to manage the complex issues related to climate change while continuing to implement their traditional primary, secondary and tertiary preventive models.

A new approach, based on ecological principles, will be required to navigate through the complex and interrelating health causes. The public health sector must strengthen existing approaches for effective climate change adaptation strategies, including assessing regional health risks to identify vulnerable and resilient populations, collecting enhanced surveillance data and developing monitoring indicators.

This approach must be based on:


	providing sound scientific evidence for predicting the likely outcomes and thus to take preventive or responsive action; and
	reorienting the public health sector towards greater comprehension and use of ecological understandings and approaches.


Recommendations

Politicians, health bureaucrats and other interested parties must formulate comprehensive, coherent policies to address the direct and indirect impacts of climate change on public health, including allocation of appropriate financial resources as part of a National Plan for Health in Responding to Climate Change.

The National Health and Medical Research Council should be tasked with ensuring coordinated, comprehensive funding to support research into the health impacts of climate change.

Research organisations and health institutions must collaborate to develop cost-effective, long-term, longitudinal studies on the impacts of climate change on the physical, biological and social environments that will affect Australian’s public health.

Advocates must develop proposals which demonstrate cost savings to government over three to six years, or one or two electoral cycles. Little will be achieved in the current fiscal environment if proposed policies and practices will incur significant new budgetary expenses to governments or their agencies.

Managing the impacts of climate change on public health will also involve several other sectors, such as water, planning, building, housing and transport infrastructure. Appropriate institutions should work towards a multi-level, interdisciplinary and integrated response to raise the importance of the impacts of climate change on public health.

A comprehensive surveillance system would monitor the inter-relationship of environmental, social and health factors. Observational studies are important to monitor recent and present disease patterns and incidence to inform modelling of future disease patterns. They could also provide baselines for environmental health indicators, which can periodically be monitored and measured in order to inform program evaluation.

The public health sector must integrate planned, evidence-based adaptations into existing preventive activities. Useful methodologies might include:


	a risk assessment approach such as Health Impact Assessment (HIA);
	an appropriate range of Environmental Health Indicators (EHIs);
	a “Driving force-Pressure-State-Exposure-Effect-Action (DPSEEA) framework”; and
	a systematic ecological health framework.


The opposite of vulnerability is resilience – our capacity to respond to challenging or new circumstances. The factors which encourage resilience needs to be better understood. The public health sector must communicate concepts of risk, and develop strategies to encourage greater resilience.

To understand how we can minimise vulnerability of individuals and communities to climate change we must identify those populations which are most at risk, including those for whom climate change will act as a stress multiplier for existing public health problems.

The health sector must communicate climate change as a human health issue rather than just an “environmental problem”. The focus should be on effective, realistic and sustainable solutions rather than problems characterised as bleak and unresolvable"
651,"Quantitative risk assessment of the effects of climate change on selected causes of death, 2030s and 2050s","Overview: This assessment is an update and a further development of the assessment first published by WHO for the year 2000, now with a wider range of health impacts, and projections for future years. It takes into account a subset of the possible health impacts, and assumes continued economic growth and health progress.

The assessment takes into account a subset of the possible health impacts, and assumes continued economic growth and health progress. Even under these conditions, it concludes that climate change is expected to cause approximately 250 000 additional deaths per year between 2030 and 2050; 38 000 due to heat exposure in elderly people, 48 000 due to diarrhoea, 60 000 due to malaria, and 95 000 due to childhood undernutrition. Results indicate that the burden of disease from climate change in the future will continue to fall mainly on children in developing countries, but that other population groups will be increasingly affected.

652,"Living planet report 2014: species and spaces, people and places","Reveals the effects of the pressures being placed on the planet and explores the implications for society.

Introduction

Sustainable development has figured prominently on the international agenda for more than a quarter of a century. People talk earnestly of the environmental, social and economic dimensions of development. Yet we continue to build up the economic component, at considerable cost to the environmental one. We risk undermining social and economic gains by failing to appreciate our fundamental dependency on ecological systems. Social and economic sustainability are only possible with a healthy planet.

Ecosystems sustain societies that create economies. It does not work any other way round. But although human beings are a product of the natural world, we have become the dominant force that shapes ecological and biophysical systems. In doing so, we are not only threatening our health, prosperity and well-being, but our very future. This tenth edition of the Living Planet Report reveals the effects of the pressures we are placing on the planet. It explores the implications for society. And it underlines the importance of the choices we make and the steps we take to ensure this living planet can continue to sustain us all, now and for generations to come"
653,What is the evidence for harm minimisation measures in gambling venues?,"What techniques are currently being used for electronic gambling machine harm minimisation, and do they work?

Overview

The use of electronic gambling machines (EGMs) in Australia and New Zealand constitutes the largest sector of the gambling industry. The costs arising from the harms of gambling detract significantly from its benefits, and in all Australian jurisdictions various policy measures have been implemented to reduce these harms. If successful, these would maximise the net benefits associated with EGM gambling. This article reviews the available evidence for a range of these practices, particularly those implemented within EGM venues via ‘codes of practice’. These codes of practice are intended to give effect to the principles of ‘responsible gambling’ within EGM venues. These measures are: self-exclusion, signage, messages, interaction with gamblers, the removal of ATMs from gambling venues, and ‘responsible gambling’ assessed overall in a venue context. In addition, we review the evidence in support of two major recommendations of the Productivity Commission’s 2010 report into gambling, pre-commitment and one-dollar maximum wagers. We conclude that there is a modest level of evidence supporting some measures, notably self-exclusion and, to a greater extent, the removal of ATMs. There is also some evidence that ‘responsible gambling’ measures have, collectively, reduced the harms associated with gambling. However, there is limited evidence available to confirm the effectiveness of most individual ‘responsible gambling’ measures actually implemented in venues. Further, policy measures implemented outside the control of venues (such as ATM removal, reduction in bet limits, and the prohibition of smoking) appear to be associated with more significant effects, based on analysis of EGM revenue data in Victoria.

The evidence for prospective measures is necessarily limited since the ultimate test is post-implementation efficacy, but there is growing evidence to suggest that pre-commitment, one-dollar maximum bets or other machine design changes may yield significantly more effective harm minimisation effects than in-venue practices such as signage or, indeed, self-exclusion. In considering evidence about the effects of existing or prospective measures it is important to emphasise that packages of measures might be more effective than single ones, and that an inability to confirm a statistically significant effect does not mean that no effect exists.

654,Strengths of Australian Aboriginal cultural practices in family life and child rearing,"This paper explores some of the characteristics of traditional Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultural practices that contribute to effective family functioning, and how these practices can have positive effects on children and communities. The approach is to gather the views of Aboriginal families and compare these perspectives with supporting evidence drawn from the literature. The findings suggest that, provided the necessary social conditions are in place, culture can be a protective force for children, families and communities.

Key Messages


	Aboriginal kinship relations reflect a complex and dynamic system that is not captured by existing non- Indigenous definitions of family.
	Emerging evidence supports some of the strengths of traditional Aboriginal culture in family functioning and raising children, yet conventional academic wisdom can be incompatible with traditional Aboriginal knowledge systems.
	The strengths of Aboriginal cultural traditions, as they apply to family life and raising children, revolve around four interrelated themes, including:


–&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Theme 1: A collective community focus on child rearing helps children—The values of interdependence, group cohesion and community loyalty are key features of Aboriginal family and community life, where raising children is considered to be a shared responsibility of all community members.
–&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Theme 2: Children need the freedom to explore and experience the world—Aboriginal communities offer their children every opportunity to explore the world around them, to help them develop the necessary skills to successfully negotiate their pathways to adulthood.
–&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Theme 3: Elderly family members are important to family functioning—The elderly are highly respected for their contributions to family life in Aboriginal communities, particularly in helping children to understand the practical aspects of life and society.
–&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Theme 4: Spirituality helps families cope with challenges—Families and communities who engage in spiritual practices benefit from a greater sense of identity, and individuals are more likely to connect with, support and help protect one another"
655,Factors impacting teachers’ adoption of mobile learning,"As mobile technology has advanced, awareness is growing that these technologies may benefit teaching and learning. However, despite this interest, the factors that will determine the acceptance of mobile technology by lecturers have been limited. This study proposed and tested a new model that extends the technology acceptance model (TAM) with three new variables: digital literacy, ICT anxiety, and ICT teaching self-efficacy.

The TAM models the adoption of new technology based on measuring a users’ beliefs and attitudes to the technology. In particular, the TAM states that two factors influence a user’s use and perception of new technology. The first factor, perceived usefulness, is the degree to which a person believes that a particular technology will be beneficial to their lives. The second factor, perceived ease of use, is the measure of the degree an individual believes a particular technology is free from effort.

Research has shown that a large portion of lecturers still resists the integration of technology into the classroom. Two aspects, in particular, have been consistently found to impact lecturers’ adoption of technology. The first aspect shown to influence the adoption of new technology is the beliefs held by the lecturers. Specifically, it is the perceived value of the new technology (perceived usefulness) and perceived effort needed to learn to use the new technology (perceived ease of use) that have been established as playing a major role in the adoption of technology. The second major aspect seen to influence adoption is the skill of lecturers to use digital technology (referred to as digital literacy) and the skill needed to integrate it into their teaching (teaching self-efficacy).

The new model that was proposed and tested measured the impact of digital literacy, ICT anxiety, and ICT teaching self-efficacy, along with the well established factors of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, on lecturer’ acceptance of mobile learning. A survey was used to measure the major variables in this study. The research found that&nbsp;perceived usefulness, ease of use, digital literacy, anxiety, and teaching self-efficacy were critical factors in lecturers’ behavioral intentions to use mobile learning. The results of this study indicated the importance of these factors in the acceptance of mobile learning. From this model, educationalists are able to identify and develop strategies to support the successful introduction of mobile technology with in educational setting.

This research has added to and clarified the existing literature into mobile learning. In particular, it recognizes the role that lecturers play in the future acceptance of mobile learning. It shows that the factors that influence lecturers’ adoption of mobile learning may differ from those of their students. It therefore highlights that these factors need to be considered when implementing mobile technology into the teaching environment.

656,Finding frames: new ways to engage the UK public in global poverty,"The aim of the study was to explore the potential for frames theory to be used as a practical tool to re-engage the UK public in global poverty.

In exploring the uses of frames theory, we have built on work by Tom Crompton at WWF-UK, who began the task of linking values to frames and thereby suggesting new ways forward for engaging the public in environmental issues and actions. An important finding from his Common Cause paper is that there is a common set of values that can motivate people to tackle a range of ‘bigger than self’ problems, including the environment and global poverty.

The implication is that large coalitions can – and must – be built across third- sector organisations to bring about a values change in society. This report responds to that call.

The basic argument of this paper is that there is a problem in terms of the UK public’s levels of engagement with global poverty. Simply put, people in the UK understand and relate to global poverty no differently now than they did in the 1980s. This is the case despite massive campaigns such as the Jubilee 2000 debt initiative and Make Poverty History; the widespread adoption and mainstreaming of digital communication techniques and social networks; steady growth in NGO fundraising revenues; the entire Millennium Development Goal story; and the establishment of a Westminster consensus on core elements of development policy.

By many measures we have made amazing strides forward in recent years, but the public have largely been left behind. The result is that we operate within social and, by extension, political conditions that are precarious in the immediate term and incommensurate to the challenges of poverty and climate change in the medium and long term.

This study looks at what can be learned from values (the guiding principles that individuals use to judge situations and determine their courses of action) and frames (the chunks of factual and procedural knowledge in the mind with which we understand situations, ideas and discourses in everyday life). Values and frames offer ways to look at the problem of public engagement with global poverty and to identify possible solutions. If we apply values and frames theory to the question of how to re-engage the public, we come up with some compelling insights into the impact of our existing practices and some striking solutions to the problems that these reveal. They may not be perfect solutions, and they bring with them significant challenges. But we believe they offer something valuable and timely: a fresh perspective.

The persistent problem of public engagement suggests it is time for the development sector to transform its practices radically. Values and frames offer pathways to potential solutions that should be debated across the sector, and no"
657,Studies in Australian political rhetoric,"Overview: This edited collection includes eleven major case studies and one general review of rhetorical contest in Australian politics. The volume showcases the variety of methods available for studying political speech, including historical, theoretical, institutional, and linguistic analyses, and demonstrates the centrality of language use to democratic politics. The chapters reveal errors in rhetorical strategy, the multiple and unstable standards for public speech in Australia, and the links between rhetoric and action. The length of Australian political speech is traversed, from pre-Federation to the Gillard minority government (2010–13), and the topics similarly range from Alfred Deakin’s nation building to Kevin Rudd’s Apology to the Stolen Generations. This fresh collection is intended to stimulate and advance the study of political rhetoric in Australia"
658,The stronger families in Australia (SFIA) study: phase 2,"This report presents a medium- to long-term evaluation of the Communities for Children (CfC) initiative.

Executive summary

This report presents the results of Phase 2 of the Stronger Families in Australia (SFIA) study, an evaluation of the Communities for Children (CfC) initiative. The focus is on examining the effects of the initiative on child, family and community outcomes. By using data from Phase 1 (Waves 1 to 3 conducted from 2006-08) and Phase 2 (Waves 4 and 5 conducted in 2010-12) of the Stronger Families in Australia (SFIA) study, the medium- to longer-term effects of the program can be assessed.

As is outlined in detail in the report: Stronger Families in Australia Study: The Impact of Communities for Children, the CfC initiative aimed to:


	improve the coordination of services for children 0-5 years of age and their families;
	identify and provide services to address unmet needs;
	build community capacity to engage in service delivery; and
	improve the community context in which children grow up.


As part of the CfC initiative, the Department of Social Services (DSS; formerly Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs [FaHCSIA]) funded non-government organisations as ""Facilitating Partners"" initially in 45 disadvantaged geographic areas around Australia. Their task was to develop and implement a ""whole-of-community"" approach to enhancing early childhood development, through consultation with local stakeholders. The idea behind the CfC model is that service effectiveness is dependent not only on the nature and number of services, but also on coordinated service delivery. The types of services offered in the CfC sites differ depending on the needs of each community, and include home visiting; programs on early learning, child nutrition and literacy; parenting and family support services; and community events. There are now 52 funded CfC Facilitating Partners.

In 2009, CfC services were incorporated into the Family Support Program, which brought together a wide range of services for children and families, broadening their scope to include services for children aged 0 to 12 years and targeting vulnerable and disadvantaged families. In the same year, eight sites were targeted to focus on preventing child abuse and neglect in particular - four were existing CfC sites and four were new sites. In this report, these sites are referred to as Stage 2 CfC sites. Stage 2 CfC sites have not been included in the CfC evaluation reported in the main body of this report; however, preliminary waves of data from the early implementation of seven Stage 2 CfC sites and comparison (contrast) sites are included in the appendix.

As in the initial phase of the evaluation, Phase 2 of the SFIA study provides a unique opportunity to consider the effectiveness of the CfC initiative. The strengths of the SFIA study include having a large sample representing 42% of the initial target population in the selected CfC and contrast sites, relatively low and non-systematic attrition from Wave 2 (when children were 2-3 years of age) to Wave 5 (when children were 9-10 years of age), robust measurements of child and family outcomes, and an appropriately matched comparison group. However, the SFIA survey cannot identify the extent to which particular children or families have received CfC services, as one of the key features of the initiative was to change the nature of how the service delivery system operates in a community context.

Summaries of the key findings of the study and some of the implications of these findings are provided in this report"
659,Serious invasions of privacy in the digital era: final report,"This report provides the legal design of a tort to deal with serious invasions of privacy in the digital era, and makes sixteen other recommendations that would strengthen people’s privacy in the digital environment.

Executive summary

Context of the inquiry

A cause of action for serious invasion of privacy does not presently exist in Australian law. A person’s privacy may be invaded in a range of ways. Such invasions may occur with increasing ease and frequency in the digital era, when the mobile phones in our pockets are all potential surveillance devices, drones are becoming cheaper and more advanced, and personal information once put online seems impossible to destroy or forget.

This Inquiry considers how Australian law may be reformed to prevent and remedy serious invasions of privacy. However, it occurs in the context of other concerns about privacy, such as those raised by ‘big data’ and surveillance by governments and others. Indeed, it seems that privacy is rarely out of the news"
660,The impact and effectiveness of equity focused health impact assessment in health service planning,"This&nbsp;ebook looks at the use of equity focused health impact assessment (EFHIA) on health service plans. It examines:


	What are the direct and indirect impacts of EFHIAs conducted on health sector plans?
	Does EFHIA improve the consideration of equity in the development and implementation of health sector plans?
	How does EFHIA improve the consideration of equity in health planning?


This ebook describes the use and evolution of health impact assessment (HIA) and EFHIA internationally and in Australia, how it has been used in relation to health service plans, examines its effectiveness and impacts on decision-making and implementation and examines several EFHIAs using case study and interpretive description methodologies.

This research shows that EFHIA has the potential to have both direct and indirect impacts on health service planning. These impacts are influenced by a broad range of factors however. The case studies in this ebook show that engagement with the EFHIA process and the extent to which EFHIA is regarded as a broader learning process are important factors that mediate the extent to which EFHIAs influence subsequent activities.

This research suggests that it is not possible to adequately describe the full range of impacts of EFHIA on decision-making and implementation without looking at perceptions about EFHIA’s effectiveness, in particular the perceptions of those involved in the EFHIA and those responsible for acting on its recommendations. These perceptions change over time, suggesting that future research on the effectiveness of HIA should look at the mechanisms by which this change occurs.

The ebook makes two theoretical contributions in the form of (i) a typology for HIAs and (ii) a conceptual framework for evaluating the impact and effectiveness of HIAs. This conceptual framework is tested for its applicability and refined.

The ebook and the accompanying publications were written to fulfil the requirements for a Doctor of Philosophy in Public Health at the University of New South Wales"

662,The ABC: an overview,"This paper presents an overview of Australia\u27s principal public broadcaster, the ABC, with reference to its origins, current composition and functions and its vision for a viable future within a changing media environment. The paper also makes reference to some of the controversies which have been integral to long-running discussion about the ABC - allegations of bias, political appointments to the broadcaster and the perennial question of funding adequacy.

Executive summary


	
	This paper presents a brief overall picture of Australia’s principal public service broadcaster, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).It describes the origins and development of the ABC and looks at its current structure, general operational policies and functions.
	
	
	The paper also discusses a number of important issues which are often raised in discussions of public broadcasting in general, and in particular, in relation to the ABC. One of the most significant of these is the issue of how the ABC is funded. The paper provides a brief background to the current funding situation, noting the debate surrounding the adequacy of funding and what may be future funding outcomes. Discussion of this issue is supplemented by detailed funding tables presented in Appendix C. These tables show funding trends and provide information actual dollars and dollar adjusted to 2012–13 prices.
	
	
	The ABC has regularly been the subject of criticism from a number of quarters; there have been frequent allegations of bias in reporting, inappropriate programming, political appointments to the ABC Board and mismanagement of funds. Recently the ABC has been accused also of neglecting its Charter obligations by withdrawing local services and outsourcing production.
	
	
	The debates surrounding these and other similar issues are also considered in the paper. Arguments supporting and criticising the broadcaster are noted throughout. While no attempt is made to draw definitive conclusions about the future of the ABC, it is noted that the broadcaster continues to be admired and supported by a significant number of Australians who see it as a constant source of quality information and entertainment"
663,Health and the primary prevention of violence against women,"This position paper focuses on the primary prevention of&nbsp;violence perpetrated by men against women. It develops&nbsp;a position on primary prevention (as distinct from&nbsp;secondary and tertiary interventions). It also identifies&nbsp;examples of good practice across settings, and factors&nbsp;for success for primary prevention programs. The paper&nbsp;has been developed as a resource for public education,&nbsp;debate and community activities related to the primary&nbsp;prevention of violence against women.Intimate partner violence is prevalent, serious and&nbsp;preventable; it is also a crime. Among the poor health&nbsp;outcomes for women who experience intimate partner&nbsp;violence are premature death and injury, poor mental&nbsp;health, habits which are harmful to health such as&nbsp;smoking, misuse of alcohol and non-prescription drugs,&nbsp;use of tranquilisers, sleeping pills and anti-depressants.&nbsp;

The cost of violence against women to individuals,&nbsp;communities and the whole of society is staggering&nbsp;and unacceptable. Every week in Australia at least one&nbsp;woman is killed by her current or former partner, and&nbsp;since the age of 15, one in three women has experienced&nbsp;physical violence and one in five has experienced sexual&nbsp;violence. The annual financial cost to the community&nbsp;of violence against women was calculated by Access&nbsp;Economics in 2002/3 to be $8.1 billion (Victorian&nbsp;Health Promotion Foundation, 2004), a figure which is&nbsp;likely to increase unless the incidence of violence against&nbsp;women can be reduced and ultimately eliminated.&nbsp"
664,Overview of Australian Indigenous health status 2013,"This report provides extensive information on: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations; the context of Indigenous health; various measures of population health status; selected health conditions; and health risk and protective factors.

Preface

The main purpose of the Overview is to provide a comprehensive summary of the most recent indicators of the health and current health status of Australia’s Indigenous people. It has been prepared by the Australian Indigenous HealthInfoNet as a part of our contributions to ‘closing the gap’ in health between Indigenous people and other Australians by making relevant, high quality knowledge and information easily accessible to policy makers, health service providers, program managers, clinicians, researchers, students and the general community.

The initial sections of this Overview provide information about the context of Indigenous health, Indigenous population, and various measures of population health status. Most of the subsequent sections about specific health conditions comprise an introduction about the condition and evidence of the current burden of the condition among Indigenous people. Where available and appropriate; information is provided for each state and territory and for demographics such as gender and age.

While it provides a comprehensive review of key indicators across a range of health topics, it is beyond the scope of the Overview to provide detailed information on other aspects, such as the availability and use of services (including barriers to their use) and strategies and policies related to specific health topics. Interested readers should refer to the topic-specific reviews that are available on the HealthInfoNet’s website. Additional, more in depth, information about the topics summarised in this Overview is included in the corresponding sections of the HealthInfoNet’s website"
665,A safe and supportive family environment for children: key components and links to child outcomes,"Aims to understand more about the prevalence of different types of family environments in society and to explore the influence of these environments on different child outcomes.

Introduction

Families are the mainstay of safety and support for children. While most children live in safe and supportive environments, governments are aware that too many children are becoming known to child protection services. This has led to a shift in thinking away from solely concentrating on responding to ‘risk of harm’ reports towards a broader public health approach to protecting all of Australia’s children, reducing the likelihood of children coming to the attention of statutory authorities. This report aims to understand more about the prevalence of different types of family environments in society and to explore the influence of these environments on different child outcomes. Using data from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children, we used latent class cluster analysis to identify different family environments and analysed the associations between these environments and particular child outcomes"
666,Alcohol’s burden of disease in Australia,"Alcohol causes 15 deaths and hospitalises 430 Australians every day, according to this report.

Summary

Burden of Disease (BoD) estimates based on current health and alcohol consumption data are integral in conceptualising the impact of alcohol on the Australian community. Such estimates are needed to assess changing trends of harm in the community related to drinking, and enable comparison of the burden of alcohol across different diseases and injuries. The present report utilises the most up to date methodology for estimating alcohol-related harm and beneficial effects and includes data on consumption statistics for Australia in 2010. This includes application of the latest methods to determine alcohol consumption distribution in population and compensation for underreporting of alcohol consumption in national surveys, and for the first time reports jurisdictional differences in both alcohol consumption and alcohol-related harms across all Australian states and territories"
667,Resilience amongst Australian Aboriginal youth: an ecological analysis of factors associated with psychosocial functioning in high and low family risk contexts,"Abstract: We investigate whether the profile of factors protecting psychosocial functioning of high risk exposed Australian Aboriginal youth are the same as those promoting psychosocial functioning in low risk exposed youth. Data on 1,021 youth aged 12–17 years were drawn from the Western Australian Aboriginal Child Health Survey, a population representative survey of the health and well-being of Aboriginal children, their families and community contexts. A person-centered approach was used to define four groups of youth cross-classified according to level of risk exposure (high/low) and psychosocial functioning (good/poor). Multivariate logistic regression was used to model the influence of individual, family, cultural and community factors on psychosocial outcomes separately for youth in high and low family-risk contexts. Results showed that in high family risk contexts, prosocial friendship and low area-level socioeconomic status uniquely protected psychosocial functioning. However, in low family risk contexts the perception of racism increased the likelihood of poor psychosocial functioning. For youth in both high and low risk contexts, higher self-esteem and self-regulation were associated with good psychosocial functioning although the relationship was non-linear. These findings demonstrate that an empirical resilience framework of analysis can identify potent protective processes operating uniquely in contexts of high risk and is the first to describe distinct profiles of risk, protective and promotive factors within high and low risk exposed Australian Aboriginal youth"
668,The evolution of Australian towns,"Drawing on census data, this report identifies the major trends in the size and distribution of Australia\u27s towns over the twentieth century. It examines the processes of change and the long term technological and economic factors driving development.

Overview

This is a historical, economic analysis of change in Australian settlement patterns over a century. Towns have been subject to significant economic, social and technological changes since 1911. This report examines how Australia\u27s town settlement patterns reacted to that change and examines the underlying factors and processes involved. It examines the interacting effects of geography, history, goods and services markets, industry, emenity and investment. The analysis reveals the important roles of competition, existing infrastructure, improved technology, longer life expectancy and increased wealth. It concludes that a stronger focus on amenity and services are likely potential success factors for modern towns"
669,Towards a performance measurement framework for equity in higher education,"This report provides an overview of the development of a potential performance measurement framework for equity in higher education (MFE) to measure progress and gaps in access to and participation in higher education for under-represented groups (Indigenous Australians, those from low socioeconomic status areas, people who live in regional and remote areas, and people with disability).

Summary

Increasing participation in higher education for under-represented groups has been a goal of both the Australian Government and Australian universities. In particular, the government has invested in a wide range of programs to support the efforts of universities to increase the enrolment and completion rates of:


	Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students
	those from low socioeconomic areas
	people who live in regional and remote areas
	students with disabilities.


To support these efforts, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) was asked to begin developing a potential set of indicators for a performance measurement framework for equity in higher education (MFE), which could then allow progress to be measured and gaps to be identified.

This report provides details about the potential set of indicators and the process used to develop them. The potential indicators:


	reflect the 4 key phases in the life cycle of students (pre-entry; offers, acceptances, and enrolment; experience during university; post-graduate outcomes)
	align with the key elements of the policies and programs to improve equity
	include a mixture of inputs, outputs and outcomes
	capture the determinants of higher education attainment, as well as the outcomes
	match with existing reporting and measurement frameworks
	use existing data sources where possible.


The project identified 61 potential indicators for further discussion amongst key stakeholders. The potential indicators were organised into a 3-tier framework that matched the structure of the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Performance Framework (NATSIHPF). The 3 tiers are:


	Tier 1: Educational attainment and outcomes
	Tier 2: Precursors of higher education attainment
	Tier 3: Education system performance.


Tier 1 encompasses attainment and outcome measures that form the key targets and goals for the equity programs and policies. Tier 2 includes predictors of educational attainment (including developmental outcomes, aspirations, and educational performance), which previous research has shown vary by equity group. Tier 3 indicators are process measures of the efforts and strategies that universities and the government are undertaking to try to create change in the Tier 1 outcomes. The Tier 3 indicators are essential for monitoring both the aim and reach of these strategies"
670,Under the influence? Considering the role of alcohol and sexual assault in social contexts,"This paper reviews research around alcohol use in sexual assaults that are perpetrated in circumstances of socialising and sexual interactions.

Introduction

Alcohol is a common feature in many sexual assaults, particularly those committed in a social context. Although there is extensive research on the link between alcohol and sexual assault, there is a lack of clarity about the exact role that alcohol plays. In the ACSSA research report Insights Into Sexual Assault Perpetration: Giving Voice to Victim/Survivors\u27 Knowledge, alcohol was seen as a tool, commonly used by perpetrators. The report will be referred to throughout this paper as Giving Voice.

The findings from Giving Voice identified a variety of ways in which alcohol was used by perpetrators in social interactions and settings in order to perpetrate sexual assault. These included: taking advantage of the social use of alcohol to enable and facilitate the assaults; as a method of increasing perpetrator confidence; excusing their perpetrating behaviour after the assault; and enabling manipulation of the effects of alcohol for the purposes of reinterpreting the assault or women\u27s memories of it - alcohol has the effect of creating a barrier to the reporting of sexual assault as women often see their own intoxication or drinking behaviour as contributing to the assault.

This Issues paper aims to review research around alcohol use in sexual assaults that are perpetrated in circumstances of socialising and sexual interactions. It will highlight key points from the literature that provide relevant information for prevention. This paper also discusses 14 transcripts from interviews with victims of sexual assault in which alcohol was present. These interviews were originally undertaken as part of the Giving Voice report. The report was originally conceived as a step towards enhancing understanding about sexual assault perpetration. This Issues paper builds on one aspect of the findings from that report - namely that alcohol is often present when sexual assault is perpetrated. The aim of drawing on the Giving Voice transcripts that highlighted the presence of alcohol was to gain some insight into alcohol\u27s role in sexual assault facilitation and seeing whether this insight accords with the wider literature on alcohol"
671,Performance of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission,"Overview: As the national corporate, markets and financial services regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) is involved in most areas of Australia\u27s commercial world. With the limited resources available to it, ASIC should be commended for how it performs certain functions and many of the outcomes it has achieved. ASIC will never be able to do everything the community may expect of it. In some respects, nor should it. It would be unrealistic to expect that ASIC could be funded at a level where all breaches or allegations of misconduct were pursued. Despite this, the size and growth of Australia\u27s financial sector and the fact that millions of Australians are involved in it, not least because of compulsory superannuation, makes it essential that modern and adaptable regulations are in place and regulators such as ASIC are at the top of their game. ASIC needs to ensure it sets appropriate priorities and that its actions encourage widespread compliance.

This report underlines the critical importance of ensuring that Australia has a robust corporate regulatory system under the stewardship of a strong and effective regulator"
672,A classification of New Zealand’s terrestrial ecosystems,"This study produces a comprehensive terrestrial ecosystem classification by subjectively constructing a heirarchy of perceived key environmental drivers.

Introduction: The ecosystem concept is at the centre of international agreements, New Zealand legislation, and modern policy and planning systems that aim to sustainably manage natural resources. All definitions of ecosystems include the concept of the physical environment being integrated with its biotic components. Functionally, the concept embodies disturbance cycles, and flows of energy, nutrients and non-living materials, with these processes underpinning the concept of ecosystem health or integrity. Since these processes operate at variable spatio-temporal scales, and species and communities intergrade variably along environmental gradients, there is no single optimal scale at which to apply the ecosystem concept. Rather, the openness and hierarchical nature of ecosystem processes lead to any one classification scale being viewed as nested within coarser and finer scale components.

One of the goals of the New Zealand Biodiversity Strategy is to ‘maintain and restore a full range of remaining habitats and ecosystems …’. However, although many environmental agencies and individuals can contribute to this goal, any investment decisions are currently being made in the absence of a comprehensive list of ecosystems or a systematic threat ranking. Therefore, classification of the full range of ecosystem types for New Zealand is overdue.

673,Enacting Kaitiakitanga: challenges and complexities in the governance and ownership of Rongoā Research information,"Abstract: This article explores the tensions one research team has faced in securing appropriate governance or stewardship (which we refer to as kaitiakitanga) of research data. Whilst ethical and regulatory frameworks exist which provide a minimum standard for researchers to meet when working with Māori, what our experience has highlighted is there is currently a “governance” gap in terms of who should hold stewardship of research data collected from Māori individuals or collectives. In the case of a project undertaken in the traditional healing space, the organisation best placed to fulfil this governance role receives no funding or support to take on such a responsibility; consequently by default, this role is being borne by the research team until such time as capacity can be built and adequate resourcing secured. In addition, we have realised that the tensions played out in this research project have implications for the broader issue of how we protect traditional knowledge in a modern intellectual property law context, and once again how we adequately support those, often community-based organisations, who work at the interface between Indigenous knowledge and the Western world.

674,"Excavating widening participation policy in Australian higher education: subject positions, representational effects, emotion","This article uses Foucauldian discourse analysis to identify two subject positions within Australia\u27s Widening Participation higher education policy.

Purpose

The massification of higher education is a definitive feature of the late twentieth century. Widening Participation (WP) policy is a recent manifestation of this phenomenon in Britain and Australia. This article uses Foucauldian discourse analysis to identify two subject positions within Australian WP higher education policy, that of the cap(able) individual and the proper aspirant. The article also traces the feeling-rules associated with these subject positions to ask critical questions about neo-liberal social justice.

Design/methodology/approach

A Foucauldian discourse analysis was conducted on a range of policy documents relating the higher education during the period 2008-2013. Using Bacchi’s (2012) ‘what is the problem represented to be?’ (WPR) approach, two subject positions and their attendant feeling-rules are identified.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Findings

The two subject positions, the cap(able) individual and the proper aspirant, represent a quintessential neo-liberal subject who possesses ‘natural’ ability, hope for social mobility and is highly individualised and entrepreneurial in disposition. As a reinvention of social justice approaches to higher education, WP has wide emotional and common sense appeal derived from its links into older discourses on social justice, meritocracy and the redemptive promise of education and childhood hope.&nbsp; A new neo-liberal appropriation of social justice, WP neglects critical historical, social and contextual factors related to educational inequity"
675,Global water: issues and insights,"This book brings together some of the world’s leading water researchers with an especially written collection of chapters on: water economics; transboundary water; water and development; water and energy; and water concepts.

Introduction

Freshwater governance holds a prominent position in the global policy agenda. Burgeoning water demand due to population growth and rising incomes is combining with supply-side pressures, such as environmental pollution and climate change, to create acute conditions of global water scarcity. This is a major concern because water is a primary input for agriculture, manufacturing, environmental health, human health, energy production and just about every economic sector and ecosystem.

In addition to its importance, the management of freshwater resources is a complex, multidisciplinary topic. Encompassing a range of fields in the physical and social sciences, the task of sustainably meeting human and environmental water needs requires a depth and breadth of understanding unparalleled by most other policy problems.

Our objective in this volume is to provide knowledge and insights into major issues and concepts related to freshwater governance. The book is divided into five themed parts: Economics, Transboundary governance, Development, Energy and Water Concepts.

A part addresses each theme and opens with an introduction that provides an overview of key topics. For example, the introduction to the economics section presents two main foci: measuring the value of water and managing trade-offs between different water uses. The thematic case studies discuss issues such as water pricing in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, finance of water supply and irrigation infrastructure and improving agricultural production with enhanced water management.

The aim of the volume is to accessibly communicate academic research from the many fields of freshwater governance. Too often, academic research is paywalled and/or written in a style that caters to colleagues in the same field, rather than a broader audience from other disciplines, the policy-making community and the general public. This open-access book presents the research of a range of global experts on freshwater governance in brief, insightful chapters that do not presume a high level of pre-existing knowledge of their respective subjects. This format is intended to present knowledge on the key problems of and solutions to global freshwater challenges.

The final part presents research from several United Nations Educational, Social, and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) supported water research Chairs and Centres. Support and coordination of the insititutions highlighted in this part of the book is provided by UNESCO. One water research Chair is The Australian National University – UNESCO Chair in Water Economics and Transboundary Governance, which was established in April 2010 and works with partners in southern Africa, UNESCO, the Global Water Partnership and other organisations to: (1) increase the skills, capacity, networks and potential of leaders and prospective water managers and policy-makers; (2) sustain and strengthen institutional capacity (especially in southern Africa) by providing a platform for collaboration and institutional development; and, (3) develop innovative research, tools, case-studies, and insights on water economics, water governance and equity.

Established by the ANU–UNESCO Chair, the Global Water Forum (GWF) seeks to disseminate knowledge regarding freshwater governance and build the capacity of students, policy-makers and the general public to respond to local and global water issues. The GWF publishes accessible, subscription-free articles highlighing the latest research and practice concerning freshwater governance. A broad range of water-related topics are discussed in a non-technical manner, including water security, development, agriculture, energy and environment. In addition to publishing articles, reports and books, the GWF is engaged in a range of activities, such as the annual Emerging Scholars Award and hosting a portal to educational resources on freshwater.

We hope that you enjoy reading this book and, more importantly, gain an improved understanding of the complex freshwater-governance challenges facing us all on a global scale and at a local level"
676,"Families, policy and the law: selected essays on contemporary issues for Australia","These collected essays explore the complexities that confront those who frame social policy and those involved in the social services and legal systems that intersect with child and family issues.

Introduction

There are few areas of policy that carry greater complexity than those that focus on families. The dynamics of family formation are, and have always been, intricately connected with the evolving conditions of societies and the constraints and values they embrace at any given era. Some things, however, are perennial. The functions families fulfil have remained essentially unchanged despite the shifts in the circumstances and challenges that families confront. Not surprisingly, the ways in which policy-makers seek to address the needs of families also evolve and, in turn, influence the changing social context.

Broadly speaking, policy initiatives seek to support family stability, facilitate positive functioning, enhance their safety and security, and generally promote the wellbeing of family members to the benefit of their communities and the wider society. Family policy involves a complex mix of social, economic, educational, employment, housing and health policies, along with a range of other child- and family-focused priorities. These policy “levers” are used to enhance opportunities, build capacity and capitalise on individual and family strengths.

Just as social policy is framed by the complexities of family and societal change, childand family-focused legal systems also confront the challenges of change. Changing social and policy contexts have far-reaching implications for the law. While legislation tends to follow such change, it can also drive change.

The collected essays in this volume seek to explore some of the complexities that confront both those who frame social policy and those involved in the social services and legal systems that intersect with child and family issues. The genesis of the volume was in a set of papers presented to the 12th Australian Institute of Family Studies Conference held in Melbourne from 25 to 27 July 2012. In reflecting on the wealth of material presented at the conference, we were impressed by the many papers that focused on topics at the intersection of policy and the law. We have added some invited essays to these conference presentations to provide succinct snapshots of some of the issues with which Australia, like many other nations, grapples in this first part of the 21st century. It is by no means an exhaustive coverage of the terrain, but a sampling of some of the contemporary issues at the forefront of thinking about the complexities of the lives of Australian children and families"
677,Innovative solutions for enhanced illicit drugs profiling using comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography and mass spectrometry technologies,"This project aimed to determine whether comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography is suitable for routine use in a forensic laboratory for profiling illicit substances.

Abstract

Analytical gas chromatographic methods usually rely upon a single dimension (ie single column) high-resolution capillary GC column to provide separation of target analyses. When a matrix is especially complex, the ability of the column to provide adequate resolution is severely compromised. Often, mass spectrometry may provide the ability to uniquely measure the target compounds, but if the matrix generates similar ions to the target compounds, this can lead to confounded analysis. Mass spectrometry offers many potential solutions to the lack of resolution of GC; however, this usually involves selected ion monitoring or similar approaches. This removes the important opportunity to use a full-scan spectrum to match with a database library. In the present project, high-resolution GC analysis using the multidimensional separation method of comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GCxGC) was used to provide sufficient resolution to allow full-scan acquisition with library confirmation of illicit drug identity. It was shown that the WADA criteria for a selection of test steroid compounds could be suitably met under this new high-resolution environment. In addition, analysis of samples of ecstasy were profiled and all synthetic residues involved in the synthesis of ecstasy could be fully resolved and located in the 2D separation space with excellent library matches, even though the underlying matrix was very complicated and would have strongly interfered in a 1D separation analysis. This will allow facile profiling of the reaction procedure for ecstasy synthesis"
678,"Sexual revictimisation: individual, interpersonal and contextual factors","People who have been sexually abused as children are two to three times more likely to be sexually revictimised in adolescence and/or adulthood. This paper explores the complex array of variables related to sexual revictimisation.

Abstract

There is a complex array of variables related to sexual revictimisation. Although prevalence is difficult to ascertain, several studies relate that people who have been sexually abused as children are two to three times more likely to be sexually revictimised in adolescence and/or adulthood. Much of the literature on sexual revictimisation focuses on the individual risk factors for the victim/survivor - their risk perception and emotional dysregulation resulting from initial sexual victimisation - and how these create vulnerability for sexual revictimisation. Broader contextual factors beyond the victim/survivor, however, are often ignored. These contextual factors are explored here with a particular emphasis on minority groups, such as people with a disability; gay, lesbian and bisexual people; and Indigenous people. This focus demonstrates that individual risk factors often do not account for how perpetrators may target vulnerable people who have previously been victimised, how community and organisational attitudes and norms may support sexual revictimisation, and how broader social norms create vulnerability for certain groups. A focus on these broader contextual factors helps to inform prevention strategies.

Key messages


	People who are sexually abused in childhood are two to three times more likely to be sexually revictimised in adolescence and/or adulthood.
	Individual risk factors include a history of child sexual abuse, poor risk perception, emotional dysregulation, cumulative past abuse, family conflict and distress.
	Broader contextual factors, such as perpetrator tactics, community and organisational attitudes, and social norms, are also risk factors for sexual revictimisation.
	Those vulnerable to sexual revictimisation, including minority groups such as people with a disability; gay, lesbian and bisexual people; and Indigenous people may require greater support and advocacy in order to alleviate trauma and trauma symptoms, and increase their resilience.
	Similar strategies used in the sexual violence primary prevention space may be used to prevent sexual revictimisation. This includes respectful relationships education, gender equity principles and a focus on important sites of social norm reproduction, such as sporting sites and the media, to convey messages of respect and equality"
679,"Changing narratives: colonised peoples, criminology and social work","Abstract: There is growing recognition in criminology and social work of the importance of Indigenous knowledges and methodologies. Yet to date there have been limited attempts (particularly in criminology and criminal justice social work) to consider the theoretical and practice implications of Indigenous understandings and approaches to these disciplines. Both disciplines have also been slow to recognise the importance of understanding the way in which colonial effects are perpetuated through knowledge control, particularly in the operation of criminal justice systems.


Our paper thus begins by examining the historical and institutional factors that have contributed to the continuing subjugation of Indigenous knowledges and methodologies. A discussion of the connections between the hegemony of Western science, the construction of race, and the colonial project follows. While herein Western and Indigenous approaches are conceptualised broadly, the dangers of over-simplifying these categories is also acknowledged. The paper proceeds by examining the distinctive character of each approach through a consideration of their ontological, epistemological, axiological, and methodological differences. Whilst acknowledging the considerable challenges which arise in any attempt to develop connections between these differing worldviews, a pathway forward for understanding both theoretically and methodologically the relationship between Western and Indigenous approaches is proposed"
680,Geographic labour mobility: research report,"This report assesses geographic labour mobility within Australia and its role in a well-functioning labour market.

Key points:


	Geographic labour mobility is an important element of a well-functioning labour market. By improving matches between employers and workers, geographic labour mobility can contribute to economic efficiency and community wellbeing.
	Advances in transport and communication technologies have broadened the scope of geographic labour mobility. This mobility can take the form of residential moves, long-distance commuting and telecommuting.
	Geographic labour mobility has been an important mechanism for adjusting to the demographic, structural and technological forces shaping the Australian economy. It has accommodated differences in the pace of economic activity across Australia and enabled wealth to be more widely distributed across the country.
	Labour appears to be responding to market signals and moving to areas with better employment and income prospects. These movements, together with the increase in long-distance commuting and temporary immigration, have assisted in meeting labour demand in many parts of the country.
	Gravity (a region\u27s size), distance and economic opportunities are the main determinants of geographic labour mobility at an aggregate level.
	At the individual level, personal and locational factors interact to influence whether and where people move. Life events and family circumstances appear to be the most important factors in such decisions, but factors related to housing, employment, local infrastructure and a person\u27s level of education also play a prominent role.
	Areas of high unemployment and disadvantage vary in their mobility — some have high rates of mobility, while others have low rates of mobility.
	While geographic labour mobility is assisting labour market adjustment, high unemployment is persisting in some regions, and there is room for improvement.
	There are no simple levers to affect geographic labour mobility. Many policies aiming to influence where people live and work in regional and remote areas have had limited effectiveness. Policies will be more effective if they are highly targeted.
	In addition to geographic labour mobility, a flexible, accessible and quality education and training system is important for meeting Australia\u27s continually changing workforce and employment needs.
	The negative consequences of some poorly designed policies, such as taxation, housing and occupational licensing, include reduced geographic labour mobility. Reform in these areas would lessen impediments to geographic labour mobility, and also have broader benefits.
	
		The community has been poorly served by the lack of progress in occupational licencing and action should be expedited.
	
	
	Improved access to administrative data would assist better understanding of geographic labour mobility in Australia"
681,"Class size and academic results, with a focus on children from culturally, linguistically and economically disenfranchised communities","This review of 112 papers from 1979-2014 suggests that smaller class sizes in the first four years of school can have an important and lasting impact on student achievement, especially for children from culturally, linguistically and economically disenfranchised communities.

Abstract

The question of class size continues to attract the attention of educational policymakers and researchers alike. Australian politicians and their advisers, policy makers and political commentators agree that much of Australia’s increased expenditure on education in the last 30 years has been ‘wasted’ on efforts to reduce class sizes. They conclude that funding is therefore not the problem in Australian education, arguing that extra funding has not led to improved academic results. Many scholars have found serious methodological issues with the existing reviews that make claims for the lack of educational and economic utility in reducing class sizes in schools. Significantly, the research supporting the current policy advice to both state and federal ministers of education is highly selective, and based on limited studies originating from the USA. This comprehensive review of 112 papers from 1979-2014 assesses whether these conclusions about the effect of smaller class sizes still hold. The review draws on a wider range of studies, starting with Australian research, but also includes similar education systems such as England, Canada, New Zealand and non-English speaking countries of Europe.

The review assesses the different measures of class size and how they affect the results, and also whether other variables such as teaching methods are taken into account. Findings suggest that smaller class sizes in the first four years of school can have an important and lasting impact on student achievement, especially for children from culturally, linguistically and economically disenfranchised communities. This is particularly true when smaller classes are combined with appropriate teacher pedagogies suited to reduced student numbers. Suggested policy recommendations involve targeted funding for specific lessons and schools, combined with professional development of teachers. These measures may help to address the inequality of schooling and ameliorate the damage done by poverty, violence, inadequate child care and other factors to our children’s learning outcomes"
682,The evolution of nursing in Australian general practice: a comparative analysis of workforce surveys ten years on,"This article describes the current demographic and employment characteristics of Australian nurses working in general practice, and explores trends in their role over time.

Abstract:

Background 

Nursing in Australian general practice has grown rapidly over the last decade in response to government initiatives to strengthen primary care. There are limited data about how this expansion has impacted on the nursing role, scope of practice and workforce characteristics. This study aimed to describe the current demographic and employment characteristics of Australian nurses working in general practice and explore trends in their role over time.

Methods

In the nascence of the expansion of the role of nurses in Australian general practice (2003–2004) a national survey was undertaken to describe nurse demographics, clinical roles and competencies. This survey was repeated in 2009–2010 and comparative analysis of the datasets undertaken to explore workforce changes over time.

Results 

Two hundred eighty four nurses employed in general practice completed the first survey (2003/04) and 235 completed the second survey (2009/10). Significantly more participants in Study 2 were undertaking follow-up of pathology results, physical assessment and disease specific health education. There was also a statistically significant increase in the participants who felt that further education/training would augment their confidence in all clinical tasks (p &lt; 0.001). Whilst the impact of legal implications as a barrier to the nurses’ role in general practice decreased between the two time points, more participants perceived lack of space, job descriptions, confidence to negotiate with general practitioners and personal desire to enhance their role as barriers. Access to education and training as a facilitator to nursing role expansion increased between the two studies. The level of optimism of participants for the future of the nurses’ role in general practice was slightly decreased over time.

Conclusions 

This study has identified that some of the structural barriers to nursing in Australian general practice have been addressed over time. However, it also identifies continuing barriers that impact practice nurse role development. Understanding and addressing these issues is vital to optimise the effectiveness of the primary care nursing workforce"
683,Understanding child neglect,"Child neglect is one of the most common forms of maltreatment. Neglect is a topic that encompasses complex issues, many of which are also emerging research areas. This paper aims to provide a broad overview of these issues in relation to current thinking and to generate discussion points for practitioners, policy makers and researchers.

Key messages:


	Poverty and child neglect are closely linked but not all children from poor families are neglected and children from more affluent families can be neglected.
	Neglect is often portrayed as the “fault” of mothers, while failing to take into account the role of neglectful fathers. The gendered nature of “neglectful parenting” may be, in part, explained by links between single mothers and poverty.
	A tertiary child protection response may not be the best way to respond to children who are being neglected—neglectful families are complex and have high needs so require multiple levels of support and resourcing. The National Framework for Protecting Australia’s Children aims to address these issues through the use of a public health model.
	For many neglected children, access to resources and education to support families would minimise the effects of neglect—keeping them out of the statutory child protection system.
	There is no quick, easy, “one size fits all” response to child neglect—the response must be based on careful assessment of needs and take into account the diverse nature of neglect and the compounding impact of multiple and complex needs.
	Where it is necessary to provide a child protection response to neglect, an effective response is likely to be long term, resource intensive, and complex"
684,The exception that proves the rule: female sex offending and the gendered nature of sexual violence,"This paper explores statistics about the prevalence of female sex offending and outlines the impacts on victims of sex offences by women, as well as issues related to disclosing the abuse.

Introduction

National and international victimisation data demonstrate that intimate forms of violence, such as domestic and family violence, are gendered. However in both academic and popular discourses there is a lively debate about the possibility of men\u27s and women\u27s equivalent use of physical, emotional and psychological violence, with some researchers arguing that there is no gender difference in the perpetration of intimate partner and domestic violence. The debate centres on the notion that domestic violence is gender neutral - rather than a gendered crime in which men are by and large the perpetrators and women and children make up the majority of victims. This debate can be dangerous as it may promote men\u27s denial of their violence toward women and denial of women\u27s experiences of violent victimisation. Denial can continue the cycle of power and control that is a feature of men\u27s violence against women.

While sexual violence has tended not to be a feature of these debates, its gendered nature (as demonstrated by the statistics) is challenged and undermined when instances of female sex offending are reported in the public domain. Like the gender symmetry debate in domestic and family violence, the occurrence of female sex offending is seen to invalidate the empirically supported notion that sexual assault is a gendered crime. It is important therefore to present what is currently known about female sex offenders in an examination of available data.

The importance of research on female sexual offending is highlighted by the difficulty in conceptualising it. In the existing research/literature, there is no real clarity around what motivates females to sexually offend. However there is often a rejection of the idea of women having the potential for violence and deviant, coercive sexuality. There is an over-reliance on gender in discussing female sex offenders (specifically in the media and more broadly on a social/cultural level) that can often lead to the notion that female sex offending is less harmful - psychologically and physically - than male sex offending.

Gender relates to the social characteristics attributed to men and women that can often be more prescriptive than descriptive of actual characteristics and behaviour. Although gender is an important conceptual tool there may be an over-reliance on gendered stereotypes in the public domain. Conversely, gender may play a role in how men and women sexually offend and ways that gender may conceal women\u27s offending. It is here that the difficulty lies - and a review of the literature does not completely undo this difficulty.

Little is known about female sex offenders, and what empirical work has been done is in the initial stages of identifying characteristics associated with female sex offenders. Although prevalence rates are variable, the general consensus is that around 5% of sex offences are committed by women. Much of the work - which began in earnest in the 1980s - has limitations due to being conducted mainly with known offenders who are in the criminal justice system, or with very small clinical samples. Small sample sizes occur because there are only very small populations of female sex offenders, as opposed to much larger populations of male sex offenders.

There currently appear to be no research summaries that bring together everything that is known about female sex offenders. This Research Summary will explore the current literature - predominantly from 2000 onward - and outline what is currently known about female sex offenders. Tables of data related to offence and offender characteristics will be presented to bring together the current available empirical evidence. The impacts on victims and issues related to disclosing sexual abuse perpetrated by women are also included"
685,"Native frog (Leiopelma spp.) recovery plan, 2013–2018","This report outlines a plan to secure the survival of New Zealand\u27s native frogs.

Abstract

Native frogs were formerly widespread and common throughout New Zealand. However, they are now much reduced in range, with remnant populations only occurring on the mainland of the North Island and on several islands in the Marlborough Sounds. The current agents of decline are thought primarily to be introduced mammalian predators, disease and habitat modification. The current recovery plan covers the period from 2013 to 2018 and sets in place the actions required to move into the next phase of recovery management for all four extant native frog species (Leiopelma spp.). In this respect, the plan spans a transitional phase to consolidate the security of the species and set the platform for their broader recovery"
686,The impact of gaming machines on small regional economies,"Executive Summary 

The primary objective of this study has been to estimate quantitatively the overall net impact of gaming machines on regional economies (i.e., economic and social impact). The study takes up from where the Productivity Commission’s Australia’s Gambling Industries study stopped - specifically, that the national estimate of the overall impact of gambling activities was of ‘limited usefulness for policy’ because, inter alia, “there are likely to be considerable differences in net outcomes among the States and Territories, and in particular, at the regional or local government levels, especially when tax flows are taken into account”.

There are also significant differences between States and Territories in the ownership and the structure of the industry and the mobility pattern of electronic gaming machines. The Centre employed a variety of methodological approaches in the study to ensure that policy issues were highlighted and that economic and social impacts were thoroughly assessed. Some components of our methodology were forwarded to the Productivity Commission for overview and comment"
687,Fly-in fly-out workforce practices in Australia: the effects on children and family relationships,"This paper summarises the emerging literature on the effect on children and family relationships of having a fly-in fly-out/drive-in drive-out FIFO/DIDO parent.

Abstract: A limited but growing amount of Australian research into fly-in fly-out (FIFO) work practices tentatively suggests that a FIFO lifestyle can have positive, negative or few effects on children and on family relationships, depending on the circumstances. Effects vary according to a range of contextual factors, such as workplace cultures, rosters and recruitment practices, as well as community and home environments, and individual characteristics. As a result, there is a high level of complexity involved in understanding the FIFO lifestyle and how it may impact on outcomes for children and family relationships. Substantial limitations in regards to the available evidence highlight the need for further research rather than providing any robust conclusions.

Key messages:


	Limited studies exist that explore the effects on children and family relationships of having a FIFO parent. Research to date indicates that FIFO families are likely to be healthy, functioning families that demonstrate high levels of communication and cohesion. Most FIFO couples report healthy, satisfying and cohesive relationships.
	Potential impacts on children include: negative emotions experienced as a result of the FIFO parent\u27s absence; increased levels of behaviour problems (particularly amongst boys) when the parent is away for longer periods; greater experiences of bullying at school; and increased pressure to succeed academically. However, some children view the extended time that a FIFO parent has at home as a positive outcome.
	Parenting is a challenge for FIFO families, particularly for partners at home to manage the continual transitioning from solo parenting to co-parenting. Providing for the physical, emotional and intellectual needs of children can be difficult without the support of a partner at home.
	The ability to communicate regularly, privately, effectively and spontaneously is an important factor that mediates the impact a FIFO lifestyle can have on children and families.
	Family support services, policy-makers and practitioners need to be aware of the unique set of challenges faced by FIFO workers and their families.
	Further research is needed that is longitudinal, engages with all types of FIFO workers and their families, and includes data collection prior to entry into FIFO work.
	A FIFO lifestyle does not suit everyone. Families considering FIFO should thoroughly review the likely advantages and disadvantages to all members of the family. Before commencing FIFO work, families should identify the resources and supports available at the work site and in the home environment and be aware of pressure points and coping strategies"
688,Restorative justice in the Australian criminal justice system,"Abstract: In 2001, Heather Strang prepared a report for the Criminology Research Council summarising restorative justice programs in Australia. Since that time, restorative justice practices have become mainstream in Australian juvenile justice and have been extended for use with adult offenders. The question, ‘does it work?’ is asked of all interventions in the criminal justice field and is most often answered by assessing the impact on reoffending. On this point, the evidence for restorative justice remains mixed. However, the literature is replete with reports of high levels of victim satisfaction and feelings that the process is fair. Further, while some significant issues remain, research conducted to date consistently demonstrates that restorative justice programs work at least as well as formal criminal justice responses. The purpose of this report is twofold; to describe and provide an overview of restorative justice programs in Australia in order to build on Heather Strang’s 2001 review and provide an assessment of current and future issues facing restorative justice practice"
689,"Review of early childhood parenting, education and health intervention programs for Indigenous children and families in Australia","This paper provides a review of prevention and early intervention research literature that is focused on improving outcomes for Australian Indigenous children in the early childhood years. For the purposes of this paper, early childhood is defined as the years from conception to school entry. The included literature was drawn from 3 key areas of early childhood research: parenting, early childhood education, and early childhood health.

Aims

One aim of this paper is to bring together up-to-date information about the range of evaluated intervention programs for Indigenous children and their families, where the information is targeted at the early childhood years. A second aim is to review research on the programs’ effectiveness in bringing about positive change in the lives of Indigenous children and their parents. The third and primary aim of the paper is to assess the quality of published or publicly available research and evaluation of early intervention programs for Indigenous children and families in Australia: the intent is to assist practitioners and policy makers in their choice of intervention programs for use in Indigenous communities.

In doing so, the paper omits discussion of programs that have not yet been evaluated or whose evaluations are not publicly available. Such programs may well be as effective, or even more effective, than those reviewed here. It also needs to be kept in mind that using the quality of research design as a primary criterion for program adoption can be problematic in Australia, where research funding is difficult to obtain and often inadequate to conduct the randomised controlled trials and longitudinal research designs that are the ‘gold standard’ for a high-quality evidence base"
690,"AIDS: a time to care, a time to act","This discussion paper helped set the direction for AIDS policy in Australia. This is the first time a digitised version of the paper has been made publicly available.

In November 1982 Australia\u27s first case of AIDS was diagnosed. In May 17, 1985, the then Minister for Health, Dr Blewett, stated to Parliament that AIDS was ""one of the most serious and expensive public health problems to face Australia since Federation"". There had been 79 cases of AIDS, which had caused the death of 32 people, and it was estimated that tens of thousands of Australians had been exposed to the virus. By the time this report was written and tabled, Australia had experienced 1,100 cases of AIDS, of which 538 people had died.

The public health crisis posed by AIDS was not only urgent, but at risk of being heavily politicised. The populations that were most affected by HIV - homosexual men, intravenous drug users, and people in the sex industry - were stygmatised or criminalised. This discussion paper recognised the problem, and proposed a reponse that was ""characterised by a respect for the human rights of those affected and a recognition of the inter-dependence of governments and affected communities in working jointly to respond to HIV.""

From the introduction:

This Discussion Paper has been written to help individual Australians, public health authorities and governments to consider and agree on the best possible ways of working together to minimise transmission of the virus and to support, care for and treat those infected with it.

The aim of this Paper is to encourage and provoke informed debate on appropriate responses to the epidemic and to assist in the analysis of possible policy components. Community discussion of the issues is important to promote agreement and to reach a consensus on the best way of responding. The Paper does not make recommendations but identifies and discusses a range of possible policy components for achieving the objectives.

The first part of the Paper sets out what is known about the presence of the virus in Australia, the way infection affects people, what behaviour and factors make people vulnerable to infection, the financial cost so far, and what human resources have been required. It provides the factual information needed to understand the nature of the problems and to elicit appropriate responses.

The second part provides a possible framework for a national AIDS strategy. It proposes three broad objectives for a national strategy: to minimise transmission of the HIV virus; to support, care for and to treat people infected with the HIV virus; and to educate and prevent infection among people who care for infected individuals.

Because many of the issues on which policies are needed are extremely complex, the Paper identifies some key principles to guide the development of policy. Agreement on these principles by governments and the community will be a significant step towards agreement on the national response.

The last part of the Paper deals with Australia\u27s involvement in the international response to the global pandemic, with the research needed to support a national AIDS strategy and with monitoring and evaluating the Strategy\u27s programs.

For each of the broad objectives, the Paper identifies a range of possible policy components. Each component listed is to be assessed for its ability to contribute towards the achievements of the objectives of the strategy. Many of the components may be rejected during the course of the community and governmental discussion of the issues. Some components are clear alternatives; others are complementary.

This discussion paper was the prelude to an extensive consultation, which resulted in Australia\u27s first national HIV/AIDS strategy being released in 1989 and has influenced the national approach to AIDS since.

691,What works? A review of actions addressing the social and economic determinants of Indigenous health,"Introduction: The purpose of this paper is to review evidence relating to ‘what works’ to influence the social and economic determinants of Indigenous health, in order to reduce health inequities, and ultimately contribute to closing the life expectancy gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. We outline a conceptual framework for understanding how social and economic determinants influence health and wellbeing, and identify a number of key determinants of health. We review evidence relating to how each determinant is associated with Indigenous health and wellbeing, and then consider specific actions designed to improve Indigenous outcomes in each of these areas in order to determine the characteristics of successful initiatives. Based on our conceptual framework, we link successful actions which result in positive outcomes for Indigenous Australians in each of the key determinants to ultimately improving health and wellbeing and contributing towards ‘closing the gap’ in health and wellbeing. We note that many actions we consider only aim to improve the situation for Indigenous Australians in regard to that specific area (for example, education, housing) and were not devised to take direct action to improve health, even though the evidence indicates that those actions may be likely to contribute to improved health over the longer term"
692,How do government agencies use evidence?,"Executive summary: Significant research gaps remain in our understanding about what happens in side government agencies in relation to the production, commissioning, assessment and incorporation of research-based evidence into their policy advice and their program delivery and review activities. Practices and capabilities vary enormously across types of public agencies, levels of government, and policy areas. Understanding these patterns and potentialities better would help focus attention on effective methods for improving the quality of decision-making through evidence­-informed processes.

Currently, public agencies gather administrative information from their own operations, as a necessary component of undertaking program management and reporting; but there is little information about how rigorous information related to programs is actually used for performance management and program review. Little is known about how agencies access information from ‘external’ sources of expertise, which external sources are favored over others, and how external information is used for developing better programs or performance metrics. One key feature of an evidence-­based policy process would be extent to which evaluation processes are built into the standard operating procedures of policy and service delivery units. Building an analysis and evaluation culture requires the availability of skilled staff as well as organizational leadership that values high quality analysis.

Although it is widely agreed that evidence-­based improvements to policy and administrative systems are both desirable and possible, we cannot expect that a democratic public policy system could be primarily shaped by objective research findings. Various forms of evidence, both rigorous and otherwise, will continue to inform the policy process. Democratic leaders will pay attention to stakeholders and public opinion as well as scientific evidence. However, persistent efforts and targeted investments could help to create more systematic link ages between rigorous research and the processes of policy-­making. Progress towards a more evidence-­informed policy and administrative system would require commitment and investment at several levels – individuals, organizational units, and cross-­organizational relationships.

Rigorous research findings on key issues are not yet available in many areas for informing policy and program managers. Creating such a research base takes time and resources. Even where reliable evidence has been documented, it is not always available in formats that meet the practical needs of policy and program managers. The professional knowledge of experienced service providers and program managers is especially relevant in social care domains where robust experimental knowledge is unlikely to emerge. Scientific and professional knowledge need to interact. The ‘translation’ of research findings into 7 codes, standards and procedures for professional practice has advanced in many areas but extracting ‘lessons’ from research findings and adopting them successfully in professional practice entails complex issues of education, relation ships and collaboration.

This brief review highlights known areas of strength in the research base for evidence-­based policies and programs, together with matters where there are significant research gaps hindering a solid understanding of evidence­use by government agencies in social policy-making and program development. The review draws attention to important background differences between the roles and resources for the various levels of government, and differences in administrative cultures and practices between policy areas and across national boundaries. This analysis leads to the identification of several key priorities for further research, taking into account what is already known concerning the key re search issues. These priorities include better understanding of:


	how major policy reforms, and associated program implementation, have been significantly assisted by rigorous research;
	the lessons that emerge from implementation and translational research in service innovation;
	sources of variation in the use of expert information by a range of different public agencies;
	factors that might improve the use of research-­based evidence by government agencies in priority fields of social policy;
	support for lower levels of government to conduct their core activities in ways that make effective use of relevant information;
	methods for encouraging best practice in relation to evidence-­based tri als, improving interaction and exchange processes, organizing expert fo rums and civic engagement, improving research receptivity and capabil ity within public agencies;
	methods for institutionalizing respect for rigorous evidence across the turbulence of political and electoral changes;
	the appropriate adoption and adaptation of international experience"
693,Risky drinking patterns are being continued into pregnancy: a prospective cohort study,"Background: Risky patterns of alcohol use prior to pregnancy increase the risk of alcohol-exposed pregnancies and subsequent adverse outcomes. It is important to understand how consumption changes once women become pregnant.

Objective: The aim of this study was to describe the characteristics of women that partake in risky drinking patterns before pregnancy and to examine how these patterns change once they become pregnant.

Methods: A sample of 1577 women from the 1973–78 cohort of the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health were included if they first reported being pregnant in 2000, 2003, 2006, 2009 and reported risky drinking patterns prior to that pregnancy. Multinomial logistic regression was used to determine which risky drinking patterns were most likely to
continue into pregnancy.

Results: When reporting risky drinking patterns prior to pregnancy only 6% of women reported weekly drinking only,
whereas 46% reported binge drinking only and 48% reported both. Women in both binge categories were more likely to
have experienced financial stress, not been partnered, smoked, used drugs, been nulliparous, experienced a violent
relationship, and were less educated. Most women (46%) continued these risky drinking patterns into pregnancy, with 40% reducing these behaviors, and 14% completely ceasing alcohol consumption. Once pregnant, women who binged only prior to pregnancy were more likely to continue (55%) rather than reduce drinking (29%). Of the combined drinking group 61% continued to binge and 47% continued weekly drinking. Compared with the combined drinking group, binge only drinkers prior to pregnancy were less likely to reduce rather than continue their drinking once pregnant (OR = 0.37, 95% CI = 0.29, 0.47).

Conclusions: Over a third of women continued risky drinking into pregnancy, especially binge drinking, suggesting a need
to address alcohol consumption prior to pregnancy.

694,Work-life balance and family friendly policies,"Abstract

This paper presents Australian and international research on work-life interaction. We review the work-life policies and practices that are likely to have the greatest impact on work-life outcomes, specifically reducing the negative impact of work on other life domains (work-life interference), and enhancing the positive effect (worklife facilitation). The review addresses four policy areas common in work-life studies of the general workforce: employee-centered flexible work practices; working hours (e.g. access to part-time work); paid and unpaid leave (e.g. parental leave); and access to childcare.

It then considers the work-life literature related to two specific industries – the Australian public sector, and health and social services – to identify work-life issues and practices specific to each industry. We then conclude with a general discussion of challenges associated with the policy-practice gap, focusing particularly on work intensification and the role of organisational culture as the catalyst for policy uptake and effectiveness"
695,Growing great teachers: review of literature,"Introduction: This review of literature is intended to make a contribution to the Growing Great Teachers project in several ways, each of which is a normal expectation for a review of literature in research and evaluation. A review of literature is a review of existing documents and reports derived from research, policy and practice in the field or on the issue that is the focus on the project. As such, it must first establish that the project is worth undertaking, that is, the field or issue is of significance and worth undertaking, demonstrating that there is a gap in knowledge that the project is intended to help fill. Second, the review of literature should suggest matters to be investigated and, often, aspects of the methodology, including who should provide information and how that information is to be collected. Third, the review may suggest particular questions that should be posed to those who will provide information.

Each of these purposes is addressed in the pages that follow. A synthesis is provided in the concluding section, highlighting the matters to be investigated and illustrations of questions to be posed.

The purpose of the Growing Great Teachers project is to consider how schools, communities and education systems attract and support Early Career Teachers (ECTs), that is, those teachers in schools who have less than three years’ teaching experience. The focus of interest for this project is particularly on these teachers in disadvantaged schools across Australia. The review that follows shows evidence that ECTs are more likely to start their careers in disadvantaged schools and that there are higher concentrations of teachers with less than three years’ experience in disadvantaged schools.

There are two parallel justifications for carefully considering the support that is given to ECTs. The first is retention. That is, keeping teachers in schools, and particularly in disadvantaged schools. The second is effectiveness. That is, supporting ECTs to develop as quickly as possible into highly effective teachers that can have maximum impact on student learning"
696,Same-sex parented families in Australia,"This paper reviews and synthesises Australian and international literature on same-sex parented families.


Introduction: This research paper reviews and synthesises Australian and international literature on same-sex parented families. It includes discussion of the different modes of conception or family formation, different family structures, and the small number of studies on bisexual and transgender parents. Particular attention is paid to research on the emotional, social and educational outcomes for children raised by lesbian and gay parents, and the methodological strengths and weaknesses of this body of work.

Key Messages:

About 11% of Australian gay men and 33% of lesbians have children. Children may have been
conceived in the context of previous heterosexual relationships, or raised from birth by a co-parenting
gay or lesbian couple or single parent.

Overall, research to date considerably challenges the point of view that same-sex parented families
are harmful to children. Children in such families do as well emotionally, socially and educationally as
their peers from heterosexual couple families.

Some researchers have concluded there are benefits for children raised by lesbian couples in that they
experience higher quality parenting, sons display greater gender flexibility, and sons and daughter
display more open-mindedness towards sexual, gender and family diversity.

The possible effect of important socio-economic family factors, such as income and parental education,
were not always considered in the studies reviewed in this paper.

Although many Australian lesbian-parented families appear to be receiving good support from their
health care providers, there is evidence that more could be done to develop policies and practices
supportive of same-sex parented families in the Australian health, education, child protection and
foster care systems.

Additional key messages, relating to specific family structures and psychosocial outcomes for children
raised by lesbian and gay parents, are included throughout the paper"

How statutory child protection systems engage with parents ultimately affects the outcomes for children, including safety, permanency and wellbeing.

700,How are population-based funding formulae for healthcare composed?,"Population-based funding formulae act as an important means of promoting equitable          health funding structures. To evaluate how policy makers in different jurisdictions          construct health funding formulae and build an understanding of contextual influences          underpinning formula construction we carried out a comparative analysis of key components          of funding formulae across seven high-income and predominantly publically financed          health systems: New Zealand, England, Scotland, the Netherlands, the state of New          South Wales in Australia, the Canadian province of Ontario, and the city of Stockholm,          Sweden.Methods Core components from each formula were summarised and key similarities and differences          evaluated from a compositional perspective. We categorised approaches to constructing          funding formulae under three main themes: identifying factors which predict differential          need amongst populations; adjusting for cost factors outside of needs factors; and          engaging in normative correction of allocations for ‘unmet’ need. Results We found significant congruence in the factors used to guide need and cost adjustments.          However, there is considerable variation in interpretation and implementation of these          factors. Conclusion Despite broadly similar frameworks, there are distinct differences in the composition          of the formulae across the seven health systems. Ultimately, the development of funding          formulae is a dynamic process, subject to availability of data reflecting health needs,          the influence of wider socio-political objectives and health system determinants"
701,The social and emotional wellbeing of Indigenous youth: reviewing and extending the evidence and examining its implications for policy and practice,"This report contains a synthesis of learnings from in depth case studies with six programs that explicitly aim to promote the social and emotional wellbeing of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people through art and mural making, caring for country, cultural celebration, school programs and mentoring. The report offers advice and tools for policy and practice in striving for effectiveness, sustainability, growth and achievement of potential.

Executive summary

Background to the study 

The project began with the recognition that many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people experience life circumstances that seriously challenge their social and emotional wellbeing and limit their capacity to fulfill their life potential. This most likely contributes to and results from the visible disparities across most measures of health, education, employment and involvement in the justice system. In this same space, however, there are many reports of programs that help young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people build their strength and resilience by discovering their creativity, capability, leadership potential and achievement. Limited systematic attempts have been made to articulate the factors that are critical to achieving success, sustainability and growth of promotion, prevention, early intervention and treatment/support services and programs working to support the social and emotional wellbeing of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people.

The Commonwealth Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs (FaHCSIA) has recognised the need to become better informed about how policy can support good practice – what works – to promote the social and emotional wellbeing (SEWB) of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander youth.

Overall aims and methods 

The aim of this project was to obtain a deeper and broader understanding of current knowledge in this area and translate this understanding into practical and useful information to enhance policy, resource allocation decisions and practice. The project involved four components with each informing the next, namely:


	a systematic review of the existing published and grey literature covering research on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander youth SEWB up to 2010;
	a review of current policies at national and jurisdictional levels and a review of programs and services specifically addressing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander youth SEWB;
	completion of in-depth case studies of six programs with evidence of success and capacity to inform across a range of settings and groups. These studies utilized a structured, focussed comparison and appreciative inquiry approach to capture insightful explorations by those with hands on experience. The data included program-specific documents, interviews with program participants, developers, deliverers, managers and stakeholders and participant observations; and
	cross-case analyses identifying themes and variations across the six case studies and a metasynthesis generating four sets of key distilled and cohesive messages to advance theory and assist policy and practice to foster program strength and impact.

702,Bail and remand for young people in Australia: a national research project,"Abstract

Funded and endorsed by the Australasian Juvenile Justice Administrators, this is one of the first national scale research reports into the bail and remand practices for young Australians. A young person can be placed in custody on remand (ie refused bail) after being arrested by police in relation to a suspected criminal offence, before entering a plea, while awaiting trial, during trial or awaiting sentence.

Although custodial remand plays an important role in Western criminal justice systems, minimising the unnecessary use of remand is important given the obligations Australia has under several UN instruments to use, as a last resort, youth detention of any kind. This research identifies trends in the use of custodial remand and explores the factors that influence its use for young people nationally and in each of Australia’s jurisdictions"
703,True or false? The contested terrain of false allegations,"This paper aims to contribute to and clarify the debate  around false allegations of sexual assault by providing a summary of  recent literature, including consideration of the classifications and  methods of defining a false allegation, whether there is a prevailing  scepticism around allegations of sexual assault, and the motivations for  falsifying reports.Key messages:There is ongoing speculation about the prevalence of false  allegations of sexual assault, however, without consistency in  definition and classification of what actually is a false allegation,  accurate measurement of prevalence is difficult.Assumptions are made about the truth of allegations of  sexual assault at various decision-making points in the justice  response. These assumptions are based on individual and societal beliefs  about gender roles and sexual assault that may not accord with the  actual experiences of sexual assault.The perception that false allegations of sexual assault are  common has negative consequences for victims of sexual assault and  society more generally by perpetuating victims’ fear of being  disbelieved or being blamed for the assault. This reduces the likelihood  of reporting.A more useful approach to considering false allegations of  sexual assault is to undertake more contextual analysis of the factors  that play into a label of false allegations"
704,The role of traditional medicine practice in primary health care within Aboriginal Australia: a review of the literature,"This literature review attempts to identify and examine, both qualitatively and quantitatively, traditional medicine practices within Aboriginal Australia today.AbstractThe practice of traditional Aboriginal medicine within Australia is at risk of being lost due to the impact of colonisation. Displacement of people from traditional lands as well as changes in family structures affecting passing on of cultural knowledge are two major examples of this impact. Prior to colonisation traditional forms of healing, such as the use of traditional healers, healing songs and bush medicines were the only source of primary health care. It is unclear to what extent traditional medical practice remains in Australia in 2013 within the primary health care setting, and how this practice sits alongside the current biomedical health care model. An extensive literature search was performed from a wide range of literature sources in attempt to identify and examine both qualitatively and quantitatively traditional medicine practices within Aboriginal Australia today. Whilst there is a lack of academic literature and research on this subject the literature found suggests that traditional medicine practice in Aboriginal Australia still remains and the extent to which it is practiced varies widely amongst communities across Australia. This variation was found to depend on association with culture and beliefs about disease causation, type of illness presenting, success of biomedical treatment, and accessibility to traditional healers and bush medicines. Traditional medicine practices were found to be used sequentially, compartmentally and concurrently with biomedical healthcare. Understanding more clearly the role of traditional medicine practice, as well as looking to improve and support integrative and governance models for traditional medicine practice, could have a positive impact on primary health care outcomes for Aboriginal Australia"
705,Hard days and nights: the final 147 days of the Gillard Government,"IntroductionThe 2010 election produced a hung parliament, leaving Julia Gillard as caretaker Prime Minister while negotiations took place as to which party would form government. Because the ALP and the Coalition had each emerged with 72 seats in the House of Representatives, both parties needed the support of at least four other MPs in order to attain a majority in the House and form government.In the weeks immediately following the election there was frenzied activity as both major parties sought to secure agreements with the independents and minor party MPs that would deliver the voting support on the floor of the House required for either major party to form and maintain government. Negotiations took place over 17 days, largely in the public spotlight.Ultimately the ALP secured agreements for support from three Independents—Tony Windsor, Robert Oakeshott, and Andrew Wilkie—and the Greens MP Adam Bandt, enabling Gillard to reach the requisite 76 votes and form a minority government. Julia Gillard was duly re-appointed Prime Minister on 14 September 2010.Thereafter she endured what many considered to be the toughest of political environments—a largely disillusioned electorate; a hostile, often vicious press; herself burdened by scandals of others’ making and pursued by allegations of her own past misdemeanours; and relentless leadership speculation within the Labor Caucus that created an aura of instability around her government and raised the ire and anxiety of citizens.This paper describes the key events and issues that dominated the 147 days between Gillard’s National Press Club announcement in January that an election would be held 14 September 2013, and the Labor Caucus ballot on Wednesday 26 June 2013 which saw Gillard replaced as leader by Kevin Rudd, whom Gillard had herself deposed on Wednesday 24 June 2010"
706,ASEAN and regional cooperation: recent developments and Australia’s interests,"This paper seeks to provide a concise survey of the Association of  Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)\u27s recent progress and major policy  emphases and challenges.IntroductionThe Association of Southeast Asian nations (ASEAN) is the premier regional grouping in East Asia. It is widely credited for its substantial contribution to making Southeast Asia more stable and more prosperous than might otherwise have been the case. ASEAN has also played a major role as sponsor of wider regional cooperation groupings which provide forums for the Southeast Asian states, the major powers and other interested countries (including Australia) to discuss and coordinate approaches to regional issues.After a cautious beginning in 1967, ASEAN has attained a high international profile. However, pursuing cooperation among its very diverse members has never been an easy task. In the past decade it has struggled with the challenges of trying to both deepen cooperation and maintain unity, when its members remain highly sensitive about their own rights to national sovereignty. ASEAN’s desired image of congenial discussion and capacity for peaceful change has recently been dented by incidences of conflict between members, including a border dispute between Thailand and Cambodia and (in 2013) the re-emergence of discord (involving the Philippines and Malaysia) over the status of the Malaysian state of Sabah. ASEAN is also experiencing pressure in relation to the competing territorial claims in the South China Sea which involve four ASEAN members along with China and also the government in Taiwan. Tensions over South China Sea issues saw the ASEAN Foreign Ministers unable to issue an agreed communique after their meeting in Phnom Penh in July 2012, for the first time in forty-five years. ASEAN’s ongoing success thus cannot be taken for granted.ASEAN is a significant partner for Australia. Australia has had a multilateral relationship with ASEAN since 1974 and will mark the 40th anniversary of this next year. Since the 1970s, Australia-ASEAN cooperation has involved both efforts to enhance regional security, for example through the Cambodia peace process (1991–1993) and through development of the ASEAN Regional Forum (from 1994) and the East Asia Summit (from 2005), and regional economic cooperation (including the multilateral ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement adopted in 2009).This paper seeks to provide a concise survey of ASEAN’s recent progress and major policy emphases and challenges. Section I outlines ASEAN’s inauguration and development and the Association’s efforts to deepen its own cooperation by pursuing development of the ASEAN Economic Community, the ASEAN Political-Security Community and the ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community. Section II discusses ASEAN’s efforts to develop wider cooperation in East Asia, in the context of the often tense and competitive relations among the major powers, particularly through the ASEAN Regional Forum, the ASEAN Plus Three process and the East Asia Summit. The paper in Section III considers recent challenges confronting ASEAN in pursuing cooperation and maintaining cohesion, including contested interests in the South China Sea, the political transition in Myanmar, ASEAN’s institutional capacities and the issue of potential membership for Timor-Leste. The paper concludes in Section IV with an assessment of Australia’s current major policy interests in relations with ASEAN, including in economic relations, political interactions, and cooperation in the development of wider regional dialogues"
707,Expanding evidence approaches for learning in a digital world,"Executive Summary: Relatively low-cost digital technology is ubiquitous in daily life and work. The Web is a vast source of information, communication, and connection opportunities available to anyone with Internet access. Most professionals and many students have a mobile device in their pocket with more computing power than early supercomputers. These technological advances hold great potential for improving educational outcomes, but by themselves hardware and networks will not improve learning. Decades of research show that high-quality learning resources and sound implementations are needed as well.The learning sciences have found that today’s technologies offer powerful capabilities for creating high-quality learning resources, such as capabilities for visualization, simulation, games, interactivity, intelligent tutoring, collaboration, assessment, and feedback. Further, digital learning resources enable rapid cycles of iterative improvement, and improvements to resources can be instantly distributed over the Internet. In addition, digital technologies are attracting exciting new talent, both from other industries and from the teacher workforce itself, into the production of digital learning resources. Yet even with so many reasons to expect dramatic progress, something more—better use of evidence— is needed to support the creation, implementation, and continuous enhancement of high-quality learning resources in ways that improve student outcomes"
708,Drinking water through recycling: the benefits and costs of supplying direct to the distribution system,"This report argues that returning highly treated wastewater directly into Australia\u27s drinking water supply could have considerable economic and environmental benefits.

Executive summary 

Supplying highly treated reclaimed water directly to a drinking water distribution system is known internationally as direct potable reuse (DPR). This differs from more established approaches to potable water recycling by the absence of a so-called ‘environmental buffer’, a practice referred to as indirect potable reuse (IPR). IPR involves the storage of treated reclaimed water in environmental buffers – such as a river, lake, reservoir or aquifer – prior to it being recovered through drinking water treatment plants and distributed to consumers.

To ATSE’s knowledge at the time of publication, there are no currently operating DPR projects in Australia and no specific proposals for their development. However, ongoing interest in sustainable water supply systems, advances in the science and engineering of water treatment, and recent international developments in DPR have prompted consideration of DPR as a potential future component of Australian water supply systems.

Any DPR scheme, as considered in this report, includes a number of general characteristics. A source of municipal wastewater is required, such as effluent from wastewater treatment plants, which is purified using advanced water treatment processes to effectively and reliably remove hazardous substances including pathogens and toxic chemicals. It would not be possible to meet all demand for drinking water through recycling, so the use of additional water sources remains essential. Finally, most DPR projects require a means of blending the recycled water with conventionally sourced water prior to delivery to consumers. Conceptually, DPR can be developed in a number of alternative configurations which differ by their arrangement of the water sources, treatment processes and blending locations.

The major difference between DPR and IPR, i.e. the use of environmental buffers, has been attributed a number of important functions. These include: additional treatment of pathogens and chemical contaminants; the provision of ‘time to respond’ to potential water treatment incidents; and improvement of public perceptions of potable water reuse. In order to maintain appropriate levels of safety, reliability, and public acceptance, such functions would need to be performed in any DPR system by engineered or other processes. This requires sophisticated approaches to water quality monitoring techniques, process reliability assessment, personnel training, engineered water storage design, and community engagement in particular.

It is instructive to observe that there are a number of successfully operating DPR schemes internationally. The most established of these has been operating in Namibia since 1968 without observed negative impacts to public health. More recently, DPR projects have been developed in the US and South Africa, with both countries now actively considering additional developments within the next few years. Recent Guidelines for Water Reuse developed by the US Environment Protection Agency state that “While DPR is still an emerging practice, it should be evaluated in water management planning, particularly for alternative solutions to meet urban water supply requirements that are energy intensive and ecologically unfavourable”. The State of California, in particular, is currently investigating the feasibility of developing uniform criteria for DPR.

Potential benefits of DPR, relative to IPR, are likely to be highly case-specific. However, potential benefits include significantly lower energy requirements, construction costs, and operational costs. DPR can also provide an opportunity to allow potable reuse in situations where a suitable environmental buffer is not available for IPR.

Potential obstacles or disadvantages for DPR, relative to IPR, are primarily related to public perception and acceptance. Importantly, ATSE considers that the scientific and engineering hurdles to implementing safe and reliable DPR are manageable. However, a number of technical issues relating to the functions of an environmental buffer in IPR are described above and would need to be addressed to the satisfaction of the general community. Key among these issues is the need to ensure reliability.

It is apparent from a review of Australian legislation and regulations that existing frameworks for the planning, approval, management, and oversight of drinking water quality and recycled water in Australia could accommodate a well-designed and operated DPR project as a water resource management option. Advanced risk assessment and risk management tools are now available which can be considered for the implementation of DPR projects, relative to more established or conventional water sources.

709,The prevention of trauma reactions in police officers: decreasing reliance on drugs and alcohol,"The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a resilience training program designed specifically to help new-recruit police officers mitigate stress reactions and the use of drugs and alcohol.BackgroundExposure to traumatic or stressful events has for some time been linked to symptoms of trauma in a minority of individuals. Although there have been many studies examining the nature and aetiology of trauma reactions, few researchers have examined whether it is possible to prevent reactions to trauma. This is somewhat surprising, given the impact that an adverse trauma reaction can have on both an individual and an organisation (if the individual is also an employee). Those at risk of exposure to traumatic events by virtue of their occupation stand to receive significant benefit from learning to manage their reactions to such events. Such a group is the police force, whose officers routinely face traumatic, sad and stressful incidents in the course of their careers.The overall aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a resilience training program designed specifically to help new-recruit police officers mitigate stress reactions and the use of drugs and alcohol. The objectives pursued by the research team were a pointed response to the current information gap in the existing literature. There were four specific project objectives:1. Undertake a literature review of the national and international evidence in relation to pre-event interventions designed to mitigate psychological stress reactions following exposure to a stressful event.2. Design a pre-event intervention designed to mitigate psychological stress reactions following exposure to a stressful event.3. Trial the pre-event intervention (resilience training) with a population at high risk of being exposed to a stressful event (police officers).4. Collect pre-intervention, post-intervention and follow-up data as a means of evaluating the effectiveness of the intervention"
710,Exploratory study of risks to stability in foster and kinship care in NSW,"This report describes an exploratory study on various aspects and risks to stability in foster and kinship placements.The report finds that compared to foster care, risks to placement stability are more evident for kinship care. Kinship carers (predominantly grandparents) are older and few have formal agency support. They cope, some not easily, with challenging situations as they arise (e.g. death/separation/divorce of partner/spouse, their birth children’s substance abuse problems, children’s challenging behaviours, their own and grandchildren’s medical conditions). The concept of older carers ‘parenting again’ should not be taken lightly. For many carers there is a continuation and increase in daily housework chores and child care routines, with little time for leisure activities, holidays, hobbies and personal time. Parenting again also requires older carers to make significant changes in the way they conform/adapt to contemporary practices around parenting, child discipline and education. Common themes suggested by foster and kinship carers for keeping placements stable were providing children with routines and boundaries; developing/maintaining strong relationships (with workers, family and birth family); receiving respite; and being supported by workers"

712,Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander art economies project: literature review,"Executive summary: This literature review surveys writing about the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander art and craft sector of remote Australia. The review has been compiled as a foundational text for the ‘Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Economies’ research project being undertaken by the CRC for Remote Economic Participation (CRC-REP). The Art Economies Project (AEP) is a unique opportunity to investigate, analyse and enhance key points of exchange within the sector, many of which are poorly understood, under-researched and characterised by different kinds of fragility or instability.The sector is a significant contributor to the cultural and social life of Australia and simultaneously creates important enterprise and employment opportunities for remote-area Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Broadly, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are more likely to be employed in visual arts and crafts occupations as their main job (52%) than non-Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people (9.7%) (Commonwealth of Australia 2012), and investments in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander arts centres generate positive financial returns to artists, calculated at a ratio of approximately 1:5 (Commonwealth of Australia 2007a).This review is linked to the primary zones in which AEP research will take place, presenting the current understanding and gaps in each of the six areas of interest: the scope and scale of the sector; the business of remote-area art centres; artists and art business outside of art centres; marketing and consumer dynamics; remote area human resources; and e-commerce and licensing.Publications describing the aesthetic, social, cultural and economic dynamics of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander art economy have been generated by a broad range of people, from economists to anthropologists, art historians to art dealers. This diversity creates challenges in assembling an encompassing literature review. Despite the range of material, however, it is also clear that there are sizeable and important gaps in knowledge about the art economy. These gaps range from understanding the size of, and financial flows within, the sector through to the barriers for remote enterprise and the opportunities for (and obstacles within) new marketing and business models. In contrast to the knowledge gaps about the commercial forces at work is a considerable body of research into the social and cultural worlds of remote area art and artists.Recent years have seen a major contraction in the art economy. The Australian Bureau of Statistics reports a 52.1% reduction in sales in remote art centres (Commonwealth of Australia 2012:2) since 2007, which accords with other anecdotal industry information as to the fragility within the sector. Understanding this fragility and the potential for expanding the success of the art economy, lie at the nucleus of the AEP’s research work.Authors:Tim Acker: Curtin University Dr Lisa Stefanoff: University of South Australia; Dr Alice Woodhead: Southern Cross Universit"

720,A review of programs that targeted environmental determinants of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health,"This review finds that there are relatively few papers describing interventions that target environmental determinants of Indigenous health.Abstract: Objective: Effective interventions to improve population and individual health require environmental change as well as strategies that target individual behaviours and clinical factors. This is the basis of implementing an ecological approach to health programs and health promotion. For Aboriginal People and Torres Strait Islanders, colonisation has made the physical and social environment particularly detrimental for health.Methods and results: We conducted a literature review to identify Aboriginal health interventions that targeted environmental determinants of health, identifying 21 different health programs. Program activities that targeted environmental determinants of health included: Caring for Country; changes to food supply and/or policy; infrastructure for physical activity; housing construction and maintenance; anti-smoking policies; increased workforce capacity; continuous quality improvement of clinical systems; petrol substitution; and income management. Targets were categorised according to Miller’s Living Systems Theory. Researchers using an Indigenous community based perspective more often identified interpersonal and community-level targets than were identified using a Western academic perspective.Conclusions: Although there are relatively few papers describing interventions that target environmental determinants of health, many of these addressed such determinants at multiple levels, consistent to some degree with an ecological approach. Interpretation of program targets sometimes differed between academic and community-based perspectives, and was limited by the type of data reported in the journal articles, highlighting the need for local Indigenous knowledge for accurate program evaluation.Implications: While an ecological approach to Indigenous health is increasingly evident in the health research literature, the design and evaluation of such programs requires a wide breadth of expertise, including local Indigenous knowledge.Authored by Leah Johnston, Joyce Doyle, Bec Morgan, Sharon Atkinson-Briggs, Bradley Firebrace, Mayatili Marika, Rachel Reilly, Margaret Cargo, Therese Riley and Kevin Rowley"
721,"Problem gambling and family violence: family member reports of prevalence, family impacts and family coping","This article reports on the Australian arm          of a  large-scale study of the patterns and prevalence of co-occurrence of  family violence          and problem gambling in Australia, New Zealand  and Hong Kong.AbstractThere exists only a small number of empirical studies investigating the patterns of          family violence in problem gambling populations, although some evidence exists that          intimate partner violence and child abuse are among the most severe interpersonal          correlates of problem gambling. The current article reports on the Australian arm          of a large-scale study of the patterns and prevalence of co-occurrence of family violence          and problem gambling in Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong. The current study screened          120 help-seeking family members of problem gamblers in a range of clinical services          for both family violence and problem gambling. The main results showed that 52.5%          reported some form of family violence in the past 12&nbsp;months: 20.0% reported only victimisation,          10.8% reported only perpetration and 21.6% reported both victimisation and perpetration          of family violence. Parents, current and ex-partners were most likely to be both perpetrators          and victims of family violence. There were no gender differences in reciprocal violence          but females were more likely to be only victims and less likely to report no violence          in comparison to males. Most of the 32 participants interviewed in depth, reported          that gambling generally preceded family violence. The findings suggest that perpetration          of family violence was more likely to occur as a reaction to deeply-rooted and accumulated          anger and mistrust whereas victimisation was an outcome of gambler’s anger brought          on by immediate gambling losses and frustration. While multiple and intertwined negative          family impacts were likely to occur in the presence of family violence, gambling-related          coping strategies were not associated with the presence or absence of family violence.          The implications of the findings for service providers are discussed.Authored by Aino Suomi, Alun C Jackson, Nicki A Dowling, Tiffany Lavis, Janet Patford, Shane A Thomas, Peter Harvey, Max Abbott, Maria E Bellringer, Jane Koziol-McLain and Sue Cockman"

724,Homelessness and leaving care: the experience of young adults in Queensland and Victoria and implications for practice,"The purpose of this study is to contribute to the understanding of the post care experience of young people who leave care in terms of homelessness and risk of homelessness with specific reference to prevention of homelessness.  The scoping study focuses on two states, namely Victoria and Queensland, and seeks to draw on the experiences of young adults who have recently left care to inform future directions in research, policy and practice.This research first asks ‘What happens when young people leave state care?’ in respect of Victoria and Queensland and second ‘What are the service support implications of this?’ A number of methods were used to explore these questions including semi-structured interviews with 27 young adults aged 19-23 years who had been homeless or at risk of homelessness, and focus groups with young people and service providers. The interviews and focus groups gathered young people’s experiences of leaving care, what has assisted them, and what they think is needed in terms of support. Service provider perspectives and current leaving care provisions were also canvassed.Leaving care services play a vital role in preventing homelessness for young people leaving care particularly for those who have a volatile in-care experience. Those who experience volatile in care experiences have variable experiences post care but can, with a combination of the development of their own networks and support services, gain the stability they need for the future. When young people received consistent transition from care support this was almost always found to be very useful, and a pathway to accessing a broader range of support.This said there are a range of factors in the way leaving care is currently approached that may contribute to homelessness. The experience of transition planning was variable with many young people saying it either did not happen, was ceremonial, or only occurred with any quality following proactive efforts by the young person or an advocate. Whilst access to long term public housing was a desired goal, long term stable transitional housing or private rental was a sufficient platform for gaining a sense of control and stability in their living situation, as long as the permanent option was being pursued. Where young people have safe, long term and adequate housing, positive supportive adult relationships and/ or service support that bridge leaving care and extend into their twenties they are able to move towards lives they see as meaningful and positive. Currently access to transitional and public housing by young people in Victoria is patchy and in Queensland very limited.Authors: Dr Phil Crane, Jatinder Kaur and Dr Judith Burton, from the QUT School of Public Health and Social Work, in partnership with the CREATE Foundation.Final Report&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DOCX [1,461-KB]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PDF [1,498-KB] Evidence Note&nbsp;48&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DOCX [123-KB]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PDF [142-KB"
725,Improving responses to refugees with backgrounds of multiple trauma,"This monograph brings together five contributions from writers who are recognised for their expertise and experience working with refugees who have histories of trauma, including torture, sexual violence and domestic and family violence.Key pointsResearch and practice with refugee women seeking assistance for settlement and other needs demonstrates high levels of exposure to multiple traumatic incidents. These incidents include many acts of sexual violence, including rape, forced sex through economic abuse (‘survival sex’), forced marriage and sexual abuse of children. Prior experiences of sexual violence often increase the isolation and shame felt by refugee victims of domestic and family violence in Australia, compounded by ostracism and exclusion from their own communities. Service providers in the domestic violence and sexual assault field, as well as settlement services, are not always aware of the extent of harm and the impacts of prior experiences of horrific trauma on the needs of refugee women who present to their service. Increased understanding, cultural safety and provision of a safe space to talk about trauma are important if services are to improve their responses.Authored by Lana Zannettino, Eileen Pittaway, Rebecca Eckert and Linda Bartolomei, Beata Ostapiej-Piatkowski, Annabelle Allimant and Jill Parris"
726,Impact of climate change on health and wellbeing in remote Australian communities: a review of literature and scoping of adaptation options,"Executive summary: This report explores the relationship between climate change and liveability in remote Australia. The term ‘liveability’ here describes the state of wellbeing realised by the sum of interactions between the physical and social environment, with health and infrastructure as the primary focus.Globally, climate change is predicted to affect liveability both directly and indirectly. Direct effects include changes in the incidence and geographical range of diseases like malaria and dengue fever. Mental health will be affected, with hot temperatures linked to poor concentration, aggressive behaviour and stress. An increase in aeroallergens and particulate matter may lead to respiratory problems and a decline in the efficacy of medication. There may be changes in precipitation that affect drinking water supplies, and increase pollutant and/or turbidly in water bodies. Agricultural profitability may change. Social cohesion may be affected as sea level rise displaces populations.Vulnerability to climate change is the degree to which a population is susceptible to, or unable to cope with, the adverse effects of climate change. Variations in pre-existing health, socio-economic status, geographical location, social capacity, infrastructure and demographic attributes mean that particular groups of people are likely to be more affected than others.Exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity to climate change vary significantly in space and time. Adaptation to climate change therefore needs to be location-specific, and both target and involve the most vulnerable groups. Policy- and program-makers who wish to manage the worst of the potential climate change impacts need to know which climate change impacts may be most relevant locally, which populations/sub-populations are most vulnerable, and their current level of adaptive capacity.Climate change is complex, multi-scaled and characterised by a high level of uncertainty. Detailed climate change risk and vulnerability assessments require climate change information at a more localised scale than is presently available, to capture the substantial variation both within and between remote areas. For this reason, this report examined three focal areas: Cape York (Queensland), Central Australia (Northern Territory) and the Kimberley (Western Australia). These three areas were selected as they crossed multiple jurisdictions, and economic and climatic zones:Cape York’s climate is tropical to sub-tropical, with hot temperatures and a summer wet season. Cape York has relatively high levels of employment in primary industries and lower levels in secondary and tertiary industries. Much of the population is reliant on welfare and employment in public administration. The population is relatively mobile compared to the national population, but is the least mobile of the three focal areas.Central Australia is arid, with low and highly variable annual rainfall. Precipitation is summer- dominant and winters are cold. Communities, outstations, pastoral leases, mining interests and tourist camps in Central Australia are serviced by the town of Alice Springs. Its economy is more diversified than other focal areas, with fewer people working in mining and more working in the arts and food/accommodation industries.The Kimberley’s climate is semi-arid to dry tropical, with a summer wet season. Six major towns act as major service centres to the region’s pastoral leases, mining enterprises, communities and outstations. A high proportion of people are employed in the agricultural and mining industries. The population is highly mobile, and there is a large non-resident population that peaks during the dry season, contributing to the demand for goods and services"
727,The impact of climate change on the archaeology of New Zealand’s coastline,"Abstract: With rising sea levels, changes in precipitation patterns and an increased incidence of severe weather events being predicted as a result of global climate change, the Department of Conservation commissioned a study to determine the potential impacts of these effects on New Zealand’s archaeological sites, which are mostly located near the coast. A Geographic Information System (GIS)-based case study examined the distribution of archaeological sites in the Whangarei District and assessed the risk to the archaeological resource primarily from sea level rise associated with future climate change.The results of the analysis are fairly conclusive. Currently, the major threats to archaeological sites in coastal areas are erosion, flooding and ground instability, and some sites are at risk from more than one of these threats. Approximately one-third of the recorded site locations in the Whangarei District are potentially threatened by these hazards, regardless of any future climate change effects. Climate change will exacerbate existing coastal hazards, and increase the likelihood and severity of impacts on archaeological sites. An additional 2.5–10% of archaeological sites might be affected by increased threats due to predicted changes in climate, including rising sea levels. The types of sites that are most likely to be affected in the Whangarei District are coastal midden and small habitation sites relating to Māori occupation. Although these could be affected by all three of the major hazards identified, they are particularly susceptible to coastal erosion. Land stability issues and flooding are likely to affect a greater range of sites, including larger sites such as pā and sites relating to early European settlement. It is not possible to quantify the risk to sites from increased land instability as a result of global climate change, but it is noted that any increase in extreme weather events would not be confined to coastal areas. These sites potentially hold significant information relating to the history of both the district and New Zealand. The implications of the study are that coastal sites are already under considerable threat, and that important archaeological information is being lost at a rate that may increase significantly in the future. Action is needed now to protect or retrieve the information from significant sites under threat in coastal areas before these sites disappear completely"

729,Deep and persistent disadvantage in Australia,"Overview

This paper is about disadvantage in Australia, and in particular, about Australians who experience deep and persistent disadvantage.

Strong economic growth is a way of increasing living standards and opportunities. Yet despite growing levels of prosperity over the last two decades, and the unemployment rate more than halving, there are concerns within the community that some Australians are being ‘left behind’.

Headline statistics on Australia’s most disadvantaged people frequently appear in the media, with the number of Australians living below the poverty line being often quoted. But little attention is given to explaining what lies behind these statistics, how much of the story they tell, and the judgments that sit behind them. Poverty, for example, focuses on just one facet of disadvantage and the basis for drawing a line between those living in poverty and those who are not is not always clear.

Nor is it often explained that many of the headline statistics provide a static picture of disadvantage. But what happens over time matters. For example, people can move in and out of disadvantage relatively quickly — such as when they first enter the workforce — while others can remain disadvantaged for extended periods of time. Following the same people over a number of years is critical to understanding deep and persistent disadvantage.

Understanding why people become (and remain) disadvantaged, and the consequences of disadvantage, is challenging. Many of the factors are interlinked, and when combined, can have a compounding effect. Measuring the costs of disadvantage, and who bears them, is also far from straightforward.

A lack of understanding about disadvantage can contribute to misplaced community concerns. It can also be an impediment to good public policy. Sound policy development should be built on an evidence-based understanding of the nature, depth and persistence of disadvantage and the costs it imposes on individuals and the broader Australian community. Support for people who are disadvantaged and the funding of programs to overcome disadvantage can also involve large amounts of taxpayers’ money"
730,Targeting crime prevention: identifying communities that generate chronic and costly offenders,"Abstract

Identifying communities and locations where chronic and persistent offenders are most likely to reside, and understanding the factors that produce the interconnections between place and offending, has enormous potential for the effective targeting of crime prevention initiatives.

This paper provides a valuable contribution to the evidence based supporting effective crime prevention targeting. By showing that chronic offenders, who account for a large proportion of all offences, are not randomly distributed geographically, it highlights those locations where interventions and resources can be effectively directed.

These locations typically have very high levels of social and economic disadvantage, pointing to the need for programs and social interventions that can effect change at the community level. Interventions likely to yield demonstrable outcomes are those that work with families and that operate holistically to address the multiple dimensions of disadvantage.

732,Sports funding: federal balancing act,"This paper considers the policy environment which has surrounded federal government sports funding decisions since federation, concentrating on the period from the 1970s from which time the federal government has become increasingly involved in funding sport at the elite and participation or grassroots levels.

Introduction

The Australian Government has only relatively recently become involved in framing, delivering and funding sports policy. Prior to the 1970s government involvement in sport for the most part was at the local level. Indeed, local government still spends more than state and territory governments and the Australian Government on sport and recreational activities. However, since the Whitlam era, various federal governments have been persuaded, albeit to varying degrees, that there are a myriad of benefits to be gained from funding sports participation at grassroots levels and excellence in performance at elite levels. These benefits range from improvements in the health of the population and greater social cohesion to economic benefits.

The World Health Organization (WHO) points out:

Physical activity and healthy sports are essential for our health and well-being. Appropriate physical activity and sports for all constitute one of the major components of a healthy lifestyle, along with healthy diet, tobacco free life and avoidance of other substances harmful to health.

Available experience and scientific evidence show that the regular practice of appropriate physical activity and sports provides people, male and female, of all ages and conditions, including persons with disability, with wide range of physical, social and mental health benefits. It interacts positively with strategies to improve diet, discourage the use of tobacco, alcohol and drugs, helps reduce violence, enhances functional capacity and promotes social interaction and integration. Physical activity is for an individual; a strong means for prevention of diseases and for nations a cost-effective method to improve public health across the population.

Numerous studies agree that physical activity is important in maintaining good health. Regular physical activity reduces cardiovascular risk in its own right and also improves levels of cardiovascular risk factors, such as excess weight, high blood pressure, low levels of HDL and Type 2 diabetes. Research concludes that physical activity helps protect against some forms of cancer and strengthens the musculoskeletal system, helping to reduce the likelihood of osteoporosis and the risk of falls and fractures.

Taking part in physical activity improves mental wellbeing by reducing stress, anxiety and depression. Further, it has been argued that sport contributes to social capital: the ‘features of social life—networks, norms, and trust—that enable participants to act together more effectively to pursue shared objectives’.

Studies have shown that sport makes a significant contribution to national and local economies. Hence, sport and physical activity contribute to the Australian economy as participants purchase clothing and footwear and sports equipment as well as pay subscriptions and fees to clubs and organisations and admissions to sporting venues. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), $8 293.8 million (1.5 per cent) of the total expenditure by Australian households in 2009–10 was spent on selected sporting and physical recreation goods and services.

Workplace activity programs have been found to reduce short term sick leave and health care costs as well as increase productivity. Australian corporate fitness programs have been associated with a reduction in absenteeism of between 23 and 50 per cent. One study estimated that on the basis of a 20 per cent reduction in absenteeism this would result in a saving of 1.5 days per worker per year, and this in turn would approximate to a net benefit of $848 million to the Australian economy.

In short, sport and physical activity not only make people healthier and more productive; they contribute to the nation’s economic and social capital.

This paper briefly considers the policy environment which has surrounded federal government sports funding decisions since federation. It concentrates on the period from the 1970s from which time the federal government has become increasingly involved in funding sport at the elite and participation or grassroots levels. Funding sport has brought with it a number of dilemmas for federal governments. These include questions about what to fund; should federal governments fund community sporting facilities for example, or is it more cost efficient to support more local government involvement in this area. One area where it appears a consensus has developed over time relates to the division of funding between elite and participation sport. It can be argued this consensus can be traced to an underlying belief that funding which results in elite athlete success in international arenas will in turn motivate grassroots participation. The consensus has meant that despite some rhetoric to the contrary, and some attempts to alter government thinking, federal funding for elite sport has always exceeded that provided for community participation"
733,Policing just outcomes: improving the police response to adults reporting sexual assault,"This report identifies failures in Victoria Police\u27s handling of sexual assault cases, and recommends reforms.

Executive summary

The prevalence of sexual assault and its consequent harm to both individual victims and society as a whole has now been widely researched, documented and recognised in Western jurisdictions for generations. In particular, policing of this gendered5 crime has been the subject of many research endeavours and police organisations have increasingly opened their doors to academics and other researchers in pursuit of evidence-based knowledge that will assist them to enhance their training, investigations and Brief preparations in this respect. Victoria Police has been among the foresighted police organisations in this regard over the past several years.

This report is the result of one major research endeavour concerning reports of sexual assault made by adults and the related police response, investigation and management involving Edith Cowan University in partnership with Victoria Police. This study was designed in terms of three strands, each of which incorporated a number of interrelated research programs. Strand one focused on victims/survivors and it proceeded through the use of an online survey and interviews of adult victims/survivors as well as focus groups and interviews of police officers in the State of Victoria and rape crisis counsellors from Centres Against Sexual Assault located across Victoria. Strand two focused on police decision-making processes and police networking in relation to complaints of sexual assault by adults. It proceeded through close reading of Victoria Police operational case files, individual interviews and focus groups involving police, and a focus group of Office of Public Prosecutions personnel. Strand three focused on the management of the police response and the recruitment, training and development of police for the specialist role of sexual assault policing. It proceeded through the use of strand two methods, as well as observation of Victoria Police training courses, police trainee feedback sheets and online survey, and interview of trainers in relation to the specialist sexual assault policing role.

734,Climate-ready conservation objectives: a scoping study,"AbstractAnticipated future climate change is very likely to have a wide range of different types of ecological impact on biodiversity across the whole of Australia. There is a high degree of confidence that these changes will be significant, affecting almost all species, ecosystems and landscapes. However, because of the complexity of ecological systems and the multiple ways climate change will affect them, the details of the future change are less certain for any given species or location. The nature of the changes means that the multiple ways biodiversity is experienced, used and valued by society will be affected in different ways.&nbsp;The likely changes present a significant challenge to any societal aspiration to preserve biodiversity in its current state, for example, to maintain a species in its current abundance and distribution. Preserving biodiversity ‘as is’ may have been feasible in a stationary climate (one that is variable but not changing), but this will not be possible with the widespread, pervasive and large ecological changes anticipated under significant levels of climate change. This makes the impacts of climate change quite unlike other threats to biodiversity, and they challenge, fundamentally, what it actually means to conserve biodiversity under climate change: what should the objectives of biodiversity conservation be under climate change? And what are the barriers to recalibrating conservation objectives?Based on key insights from the scientific literature on climate change and biodiversity, the project developed three adaptation propositions about managing biodiversity:Conservation strategies accommodate large amounts of ecological change and the likelihood of significant climate change–induced loss in biodiversity.&nbsp;Strategies remain relevant and feasible under a range of possible future trajectories of ecological change.Strategies seek to conserve the multiple different dimensions of biodiversity that are experienced and valued by society.&nbsp;Together these propositions summarise the challenge of future climate change for biodiversity conservation, and define a new way of framing conservation we called the ‘climate ready’ approach. In the near term, conservation strategies may be able to include some consideration of these propositions. However, under significant levels of climate change many of the current approaches to conservation will become increasingly difficult and ineffective (e.g. maintaining community types in their current locations). This challenge is fundamentally different from that posed by other threats to biodiversity, and the climate-ready approach is akin to a paradigm shift in conservation.The project used a review of 26 conservation strategy documents (spanning scales from international to local) and four case studies with conservation agencies to test and refine the climate-ready approach. The project found the approach to be robust and highly relevant; in the majority of situations, if adopted, it would lead to significant changes in the objectives and priorities of conservation. There were also many ‘green shoots’ of elements of the new approach in existing conservation practice. However, the project found there are currently substantial barriers to fully adopting a climate-ready approach. These include the need for:&nbsp;further development of ecological characterisation of ecosystem health and human activities in landscapesmuch better understanding of how society values different aspects of biodiversity, including ecosystems and landscapesdevelopment of policy tools to codify and implement new ecologically robust and socially endorsed objectives.&nbsp;&nbsp;Anticipated future climate change is very likely to have a wide range of different types of ecological impact on biodiversity across the whole of Australia.

736,"The critical decade 2013: climate change science, risks and responses","Two years ago the Climate Commission warned that 2011-2020 is the ‘Critical Decade’ for tackling climate change. In particular, this is the Critical Decade for turning around rising emissions of greenhouse gases and putting us on the pathway to stabilising the climate system.

One quarter of the way through the Critical Decade, many consequences of climate change are already evident, and the risks of further climate change are better understood. It is clear that global society must virtually decarbonise in the next 30-35 years. This means that most of the fossil fuel reserves must stay in the ground.

Key findings:

1.&nbsp;Our understanding of the climate system has continued to strengthen.


	Over the past half-century rapid changes have been observed across the world in many features of the climate system, including heating of the ocean and the air; changing rainfall patterns; reduction in the area of Arctic sea-ice; mass loss of polar ice sheets; increasing sea level; and changes in life cycles and distribution of many plants and animals.
	There is very strong consensus that the climate is changing and that human activities, like the burning of fossil fuels, are the primary cause.
	Scientists are now moving to new challenges, for instance, improving our understanding of shifting rainfall patterns and of potential abrupt or irreversible changes in major features of the climate system.


2.&nbsp;We are already seeing the social, economic and environmental consequences of a changing climate. Many of the risks scientists warned us about in the past are now happening.


	Heatwaves: The duration and frequency of heatwaves and extremely hot days have increased across Australia and around the world. The number of heatwaves is projected to increase significantly into the future.
	Bushfire weather: Climate change has already increased the risk of extreme fire weather in some parts of Australia, especially the populous southeast.
	Rainfall patterns are shifting. The southwest corner of Western Australia and much of eastern Australia has become drier since 1970. The southwest and southeast corners of Australia are likely to remain drier than the long-term average or become even drier.
	Sea-level rise: Global average sea level is now rising at a rate of 3 cm per decade and will continue to rise through the rest of this century and beyond, contributing to an increased frequency of coastal flooding around the world including Australia. For example, Fremantle has already experienced a three-fold increase in high sea level events since 1950.


3.&nbsp;The changing climate poses substantial risks for health, property, infrastructure, agriculture and natural ecosystems.


	Health: Heat causes more deaths than any other type of extreme weather event in Australia. Increasing intensity and frequency of extreme heat poses health risks for Australians and can put additional pressure on health services. Changes in temperature and rainfall may allow mosquito-borne illness like dengue fever to spread south.
	Property and infrastructure across Australia has been built for previous climatic conditions and much of it is ill prepared to cope with increasingly frequent and/or intense extreme weather.
	Agriculture: Changing rainfall patterns and increasing risk of extreme heat and bushfire weather present challenges for Australian agriculture. Production of temperature- and water-sensitive broadacre crops, fruit, vegetables and wine grapes need to adapt to these changing growing conditions or move to locations where growing conditions are becoming more amenable for their production.
	Natural ecosystems: Many Australian plants and animals are already responding to climate change be changing their distributions and the timing of life cycles. Climate change, in combination with other stresses, is increasing the risk of species extinctions and threatening many iconic ecosystems including the Great Barrier Reef, Kakadu National Park and the alpine zone.


4.&nbsp;Three years into the Critical Decade it is clear: substantial progress is being made globally to reduce emissions. However, far more will need to be done to stabilise the climate. The decisions we make from now to 2020 will largely determine the severity of climate change our children and grandchildren experience.


	There has been meaningful global progress in the last two years. All major economies, including China and the United States, are putting in place solutions to drive down emissions and grow renewable energy. It will take some time to see the impact of these policies.
	Carbon dioxide concentrations are at the highest level in over one million years. Despite global efforts they continue to increase at the fastest at a rate much faster than at any other time on the recent geological record.
	Most nations of the world, including Australia, have agreed that the risks of a changing climate beyond 2°C are unacceptably high. The temperature rise is already approaching 1degrees Celsius above pre-industrial, nearly halfway to the 2°C limit.
	The best chance for staying below the 2°C limit requires global emissions to begin declining as soon as possible and by 2020 at the latest. Emissions need to be reduced to nearly zero by 2050.
	Stabilising the climate within the 2°C limit remains possible provided that we redouble our efforts this decade and beyond.


5.&nbsp;Most of the available fossil fuels cannot be burnt if we are to stabilise the climate this century.


	The burning of fossil fuels represents the most significant contributor to climate change.
	From today until 2050 we can emit no more than 600 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide to have a good chance of staying within the 2°C limit.
	Based on estimates by the International Energy Agency, emissions from using all the world’s fossil fuel reserves would be around five times this budget. Burning all fossil fuels reserves would lead to unprecedented changes in climate so severe that they will challenge the existence of our society as we know it today.
	It is clear that most fossil fuels must be left in the ground and cannot be burned.
	Storing carbon in soils and vegetation is part of the solution but cannot substitute for reducing fossil fuel emissions"

Given the broad scale and fundamental transformations occurring to the natural environment due to anthropogenic climate change in the present era, what does the future hold for Aboriginal people in remote arid regions of Australia? &nbsp;In searching for answers to this question, this study takes an interior arid-zone region, the Upper Georgina River Basin in northwest Queensland (Figure 1) as the focus for a scoping study in which to investigate and document Aboriginal perceptions and knowledge of climate change, and the capacity of regional communities to respond and adapt to such change at a number of levels; specifically anticipatory adaptation or preparedness for particular types of climate change, land and riverine management, housing and settlement adaptation as well as enterprise development opportunities arising from new forms of adaptation processes. Based on these findings, a set of Regional Climate Change Adaptation Planning principles and strategies has been generated. The relevance of aspects of this adaptation plan can be extrapolated for use in other arid zone regions where applicable. The study also analyses the implications for climate change adaptation policy relevant to Aboriginal communities at different jurisdictional levels, including across state and local government borders. &nbsp;The study was carried out by a multi-disciplinary team of researchers and local community and business personnel who are already engaged in research projects in the region, led by staff of the Aboriginal Environments Research Centre at University of Queensland and Myuma Pty Ltd, an Aboriginal enterprise and training organisation at Camooweal in north-west Queensland.

740,A framework for adaptation of Australian households to heat waves,"AbstractClimate change is leading to an increased frequency and severity of heat waves. Spells of several consecutive days of unusually high temperatures have led to increased mortality rates for the more vulnerable in the community. The problem is compounded by the escalating energy costs and increasing peak electrical demand as people become more reliant on air conditioning. Domestic air conditioning is the primary determinant of peak power demand which has been a major driver of higher electricity costs.&nbsp;This report presents the findings of multidisciplinary research which develops a national framework to evaluate the potential impacts of heat waves. It presents a technical, social and economic approach to adapt Australian residential buildings to ameliorate the impact of heat waves in the community and reduce the risk of its adverse outcomes.Through the development of a methodology for estimating the impact of global warming on key weather parameters in 2030 and 2050, it is possible to re-evaluate the size and anticipated energy consumption of air conditioners in future years for various climate zones in Australia. &nbsp;Over the coming decades it is likely that mainland Australia will require more cooling than heating. &nbsp;While in some parts the total electricity usage for heating and cooling may remain unchanged, there is an overall significant increase in peak electricity demand, likely to further drive electricity prices. &nbsp;Through monitoring groups of households in South Australia, New South Wales and Queensland, the impact of heat waves on both thermal comfort sensation and energy consumption for air conditioning has been evaluated. The results show that households are likely to be able to tolerate slightly increased temperature levels indoors during periods of high outside temperatures.&nbsp;The research identified that household electricity costs are likely to rise above what is currently projected due to the impact of climate change. Through a number of regulatory changes to both household design and air conditioners, this impact can be minimised. &nbsp;A number of proposed retrofit and design measures are provided, which can readily reduce electricity usage for cooling at minimal cost to the household. &nbsp;Using a number of social research instruments, it is evident that households are willing to change behaviour rather than to spend money. Those on lower income and elderly individuals are the least able to afford the use of air conditioning and should be a priority for interventions and assistance. Increasing community awareness of cost-effective strategies to manage comfort and health during heat waves is a high priority recommended action.Overall, the research showed that a combined approach including behaviour change, dwelling modification and improved air conditioner selection can readily adapt Australian households to the impact of heat waves, reducing the risk of heat related deaths and household energy costs.Climate change is leading to an increased frequency and severity of heat waves.

741,"Creating a climate for food security: the business, people &amp; landscapes in food production","AbstractBalancing human and environmental needs is urgent where food security and sustainability are under pressure from population increases and changing climates. Requirements of food security, social justice and environmental justice exacerbate the impact of agriculture on the supporting ecological environment. Viability of the Australian rural economy is intrinsically linked to food production and food security requiring systematic evaluation of climate change adaptation strategies for agricultural productivity.This food-systems research drew on global climate change literature to identify risks and adaptation.

742,The personal and national costs of lost labour force participation due to arthritis: an economic study,"Arthritis is a common and costly health condition internationally. The direct medical costs of arthritis are significant, with the condition being the fourth most common reason for seeking general practitioner medical care. Treatment of arthritis in Australia cost around $4 billion (AU) in health system expenditure in 2004–05, the fourth largest cause of health expenditure in the country. However, this figure covers only the direct medical costs, and the indirect costs, are considered to be larger. Within Australia arthritis has been listed as a ‘National Health Priority Area’, and affects 15% of the population. By 2020 the prevalence of the condition is estimated&nbsp;to increase, with arthritis potentially affecting 35% of the Australian population. Arthritis can cause significant activity limitation, and is responsible for around 13% of the disability reported in Australia. Due to its impact on functional ability, arthritis is associated with decreased labour force participation rates. Within Australia the impact of arthritis on labour force participation among people in the pre-retirement age group of 45 to 64 years is significant – with people suffering from arthritis being 3 times more likely to be out of the labour force than those with no chronic health condition.Authors:&nbsp;Deborah J Schofield, Rupendra N Shrestha, Richard Percival, Megan E Passey, Emily J Callander&nbsp;and Simon J Kell"
743,EverFarm® - Climate adapted perennial-based farming systems for dryland agriculture in southern Australia,"AbstractAustralian dryland agriculture will be affected by climate change in a number of ways. First, higher temperatures and changes to rainfall are likely to create greater variability of crop yields and livestock productivity. Second, government policies introduced to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions are likely to influence production costs and commodity prices. Third, global trade patterns are likely to alter as populations increase, and as climate change continues to affect producers and consumers worldwide. This will create both challenges and opportunities for Australian agriculture.Farmers will have to respond to the additional challenge of climate change even when it is compounded by existing long term stresses associated with declining terms of trade, climate variability and existing environmental issues. Investing in new land-use options to combat climate change, with their associated risks, is made more difficult by being set against a backdrop of declining profitability.&nbsp;The opportunity to create transformational change in farming enterprises was tested by combining the multiple components of the potential future perennial‐based dryland farming systems and assessing their expected contribution to climate change adaptation. This project has found that adopting perennial pastures for livestock grazing and tree crops for biomass production, when planted on appropriate soils, can improve profitability when compared to the existing land uses facing a changing climate. &nbsp;In some farming systems increased cropping is likely to result in improved future farm profits.This work demonstrated that Mallees as a biomass tree crop can be cohesively integrated into existing farming systems with minimal interruption to normal operations of livestock and cropping enterprises.

744,Indigenous women&#039;s preference for climate change adaptation and aquaculture development to build capacity in the Northern Territory,"Abstract

Research was carried out on South Goulburn Island, Northern Territory, to improve understandings of local, Indigenous people’s dependency on marine resources, and of their perspectives on climate change, and aquaculture as a means towards adapting to climate change. Workshops and interviews were carried out mostly with women, but also some men with an emphasis on the use of participatory and visual techniques to encourage discussion of the future.

Customary knowledge, particularly of the marine environment, appeared to be an integral part of people’s construction of identity. The collection of ‘bushfoods’ had importance in improving and maintaining people’s wellbeing, well beyond nutritional benefits. Participant discussions indicated very limited understanding of western concepts of climate change. Many reported noticing patterns of environmental change in their ‘country’. These observations, combined with movement away from certain customary practices and loss of local knowledge, caused worry to many participants, particularly older generations.

Participants demonstrated a worldview strongly dominated by social and cultural links to the past and present but with weaker linkages to western concepts of ‘the future’. Thus, discussions around planning for adaptation did not fit easily into conceptualisation by many participants, especially when focused on climate change. People’s preferences to adaptation usually concerned building general community capacity, drawing from customary knowledge, being more involved in government decision-making and learning more about scientific knowledge. Enabling greater collection of bushfoods and associated interaction with the landscape was also considered key to improving community independence, resilience and wellbeing.

Participants showed strong interest in aquaculture as an option to help diversify food sources and minimise reliance on store purchased foods and provide income for the community – especially under future climate uncertainty. Many older participants saw aquaculture as a way to encourage greater involvement of younger generations in sea management and consequently building autonomy and skills. People preferred low maintenance aquaculture, carried out in a way respectful to culture, directed by community, with support from scientists. Many participants indicated they would feel strong pride if a community enterprise based on customary knowledge could be developed. There was considerable faith in the local corporation in managing decisions relating to aquaculture and adaptation. However, people had limited understanding of aquaculture practices, technology and logistics and capacity involved in establishing and maintaining enterprises. And although people desired greater employment and skills, conventional employment was not a high aspiration except where work was closely related to the natural environment.

Implementing programs of ‘aquaculture for adaptation’ will require improved communication and learning among all stakeholders. This involves developing long-term relationships built on trust, awareness of different worldviews on adaptation, planning, resource management and development. Supporting aquaculture development on Goulburn Island may help adaptation by expanding livelihood options and enhancing collection and local consumption of bushfoods. However, logistics of implementation will be complicated, and will need to be part of a wider set of options. An adaptive management approach that involves community, decision-makers and researchers planning and testing ideas and developing workable solutions could provide the inclusiveness that local community desire.

745,Climate change refugia for terrestrial biodiversity,"AbstractWe are currently facing the likelihood of severe climate change before the close of the century. In the face of such a global driver of species loss, we urgently need to identify refugia that will shelter species from the worst impacts of climate change. This &nbsp;will be &nbsp;a critical component of successful conservation and management of our biodiversity. Despite this, little is known about how best to identify refugia in the landscape, and the practical strategies needed to identify, protect and expand refugia are just beginning to be developed. Identifying refugia that will protect most species, or large numbers of species, remains a complex and daunting endeavour due to the large variations in climatic and biotic requirements of species.&nbsp;A first step to identifying refugia for biodiversity across Australia is to locate the areas which show the least change into the future (i.e. the most environmentally stable), particularly along axes of temperature and precipitation. The second and crucial step is to identify the areas that will retain most of their biodiversity and provide opportunities for additional species to relocate to into the future. Using these approaches in this project, we take the first steps to identify refugial areas across the Australian continent under contemporary climate change scenarios. We find that the southern and eastern parts of the continent contain refugia that many species will retreat to over the next 75 years, but that the current reserve system may be inadequate to allow species to shift to and persist in these areas. Disturbingly, we also find that there is a large portion of the Australian vertebrate community for which adequate natural refugia do not appear to exist. Fine-scaled regional analyses will be required to clarify these broad findings, and we examine a number of case studies demonstrating how these regional analyses might best proceed.&nbsp;Lessons learnt across the multiple techniques employed in this study include:1. High elevation areas are important refugia.2. Tasmania and the east coast of mainland Australia contain most of the key areas for refugia into the future.3.

746,Compulsory licensing of patents,"This report presents background information for an inquiry on the compulsory licensing provisions of the Patents Act 1990 (Cwlth).

Key points:

Like most countries, Australia has legislated a system of compulsory licensing so that patent owners can be compelled to license their inventions to others in a limited range of circumstances.


	Survey data and participants’ comments confirm that this is a safeguard which only needs to be invoked in exceptional cases. In response to surveys, patent owners indicate that often they would prefer to license more than they do.
	There have been few applications for a compulsory licence in Australia, and none have been successful. While this is consistent with its status as a rarely needed safeguard, another factor may be the costly and time-consuming process involved in obtaining a compulsory licence order from the Federal Court.
	There are no clear alternatives to the Federal Court that would make compulsory licence applications significantly less costly and time consuming, without also raising concerns about the quality of outcomes and scope for appeals.
	There is, however, a clear case to reform the criteria for a compulsory licence.




	There are currently provisions in both the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cwlth) and Patents Act 1990 (Cwlth) to address anticompetitive behaviour. To remove overlap and inconsistency, when a patent is used to engage in unlawful anticompetitive conduct, a compulsory licence should only be available under the Competition and Consumer Act.
	A public interest test should replace existing criteria based on the ‘reasonable requirements of the public’ in the Patents Act. This would provide an access regime when greater use of a patented invention would deliver a substantial net benefit to the community.




	To reduce uncertainty about international treaty obligations on compulsory licensing, the existing general requirement in the Patents Act to satisfy such obligations should be deleted, and the obligations should be incorporated directly into the Patents Act or its subordinate legislation.
	To improve awareness of compulsory licensing, IP Australia and the ACCC should jointly develop a plain English guide and make it available on their websites.
	The Patents Act contains a less costly and time-consuming alternative to compulsory licensing — termed ‘Crown use’ — that can be invoked when an invention is used for the services of a government. Two key reforms are proposed in this regard.
	
		&nbsp;
		
			To reduce uncertainty about the scope of Crown use, the Patents Act should be amended to make it clear that Crown use can be invoked for the provision of a service that the Australian, State and/or Territory Governments have primary responsibility for providing or funding.
			To improve transparency and accountability, governments should be required to first seek a negotiated outcome, and publicly state the reasons for invoking Crown use in advance, except in emergencies. Governments should in all cases be required to obtain Ministerial approval to invoke Crown use, and be subject to the same pricing principles as for compulsory licensing"
747,Designing landscapes for biodiversity under climate change,"&nbsp;Landscape design – the particular placement of areas devoted to restoration of native vegetation at landscape scales – is a primary approach to climate adaptation for biodiversity management. &nbsp;It may facilitate the maintenance of larger populations as well as shifts in species distributions, both of which should help native species adjust to changing climates. &nbsp;However, it is unclear exactly how to design landscapes to best achieve these goals, particularly because a range of possible changes in land uses and shifts in species distributions are expected under climate change and these could interact with landscape design approaches for biodiversity. &nbsp;We investigated whether one or more current approaches to landscape design would be robust to future climates – would tend to improve the likelihood of persistence for native species (and decrease the likelihood of persistence for key invasive species) across a range of plausible futures. &nbsp;Specifically, we selected two case study landscapes in south-eastern and north-eastern New South Wales and modelled 48 future landscapes for each. &nbsp;Future landscapes were constructed from four storylines of land-use change based on different future climates, two global climate models applied with future climates to model future vegetation communities, and three current approaches to landscape design plus controls for both spatial planning and total amount of restoration. &nbsp;We then used a metapopulation capacity model to evaluate the change in each landscape’s capacity to support viable populations relative to the current landscape. &nbsp;We modelled four native species groups: native orchids, fauna that specialise on wet forest environments, and two groups of fauna that specialise on grassy woodland and dry forest environments. &nbsp;We also modelled two invasive species, red fox (Vulpes vulpes) and peppercorn tree (Schinus molle). &nbsp;We then analysed whether the change in metapopulation capacity across all future landscapes for all species was influenced by landscape design principles. &nbsp;We used Generalised Linear Models and compared 14 candidate models based on alternative hypotheses using Akaike’s Information Criterion.We found no effect of detailed spatial placement of restoration projects on the change in metapopulation capacity of our future landscapes. &nbsp;Only our positive control – restoring landscapes to ~30% native vegetation cover – improved future landscapes relative to current landscapes. &nbsp;All current design approaches failed to fully compensate for losses in metapopulation capacity resulting from climate-related changes in land use and native vegetation communities. &nbsp;However, the effect of design principles differed across species. &nbsp;The capacity of landscapes to support wet forest specialist fauna declined regardless of landscape design, and the invasive peppercorn tree increased with landscape improvements for native species. &nbsp;Improvement in metapopulation capacity also depended on land-use change storyline, so spatial planning of changes in land use may provide an additional management lever that is currently underutilised. &nbsp;We suggest that current approaches to landscape planning may not be sufficient to serve as climate adaptation strategies for biodiversity. &nbsp;A variety of new approaches need to be explored even if they may be challenging to implement. &nbsp;Greater concentration of effort in priority corridors, with local actions to match local goals, may be the best immediate action until new solutions are developed.Please cite this report as:Doerr, V, Williams, K, Drielsma, M, Doerr, E, Davies, M, Love, J, Langston, A, Low Choy, S, Manion, G, Cawsey, M, McGinness, H, Jovanovic, T, Crawford, D, Austin, M, Ferrier, S 2013 Designing landscapes for biodiversity under climate change, &nbsp;National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility, Gold Coast, pp. 276.&nbsp;AbstractLandscape design – the particular placement of areas devoted to restoration of native vegetation at landscape scales – is a primary approach to climate adaptation for biodiversity management. &nbsp;It may facilitate the maintenance of larger populations as well as shifts in species distributions, both of which should help native species adjust to changing climates.

748,What about me? Factors affecting individual adaptive coping capacity across different populations,"&nbsp;When and why will people adapt to climate change? We conducted a number of studies examining the psychological drivers of individual adaptation to climate change across different populations. We used a variety of methodologies including interviews, surveys, survey experiments and face-to-face experiments. There was a high level of rigour involved in each of these methodologies which means that we can believe in the results. This programme of research represents one of the largest and most integrated attempts to understand some of the psychological drivers of individual-level adaptation.First, we used the most recent advances in the psychological literature of coping more generally to develop a valid scale to measure coping with climate change. Across three studies we found that our tool was both reliable and valid, providing an accurate measure of the different ways in which people cope with climate change. This tool can now be used to understand the effects of both adaptive and maladaptive coping and to understand what leads to these different ways of coping.Next, we examined adaptive capacity. We found that adaptive coping strategies were associated with perceiving climate change as a threat to oneself and one’s way of life, rating environmental goals as important, and believing that adaptive behaviours could help achieve significant personal goals. Furthermore, when looking at societal adaptive capacity (support for governmental policies) we found that not only were a threat appraisal, climate change or environmental goal, and goal connectedness related to support, but also political affiliation, perceived human contribution to climate change, (lack of) denying that climate change exists, and a number of emotions (enthusiasm, worry, (lack of) happiness, and (lack of ) embarrassment). By knowing these factors that lead to adaptive coping and support for adaptive policies we can identify strategies to improve individual adaptive capacity.Third, based on a range of psychological literature, we hypothesised that adaptive behaviour would be related to goals, goal connectedness, adaptive coping, beliefs about climate change (including denial), and emotions that create an uneasy state of activation (enthusiasm and hope combined with worry). We found support for each of these relationships. Thus, we can again identify strategies to increase adaptive climate change behaviour.&nbsp;Across the studies, we found that adaptive capacity and adaptive behaviours relied upon both “green” beliefs and goals and “non-green” beliefs and goals. Moreover, believing that the adaptive behaviours helped a person to achieve their goals (whether they were related to climate change or not) was strongly related to adaptive capacity and behaviour. We have therefore shown that we can improve adaptation not only in those people who want to help the environment but also in those who are less interested.Unfortunately, the goal structure of environmental goals appears difficult to change. However, making people think about politics did have an effect: Regardless of their own political orientation, a person’s belief about the degree of human contribution to climate change decreased when they were thinking about politics (compared to not thinking about politics). This has implications for how climate change adaptation is discussed in the media and by researchers.The results of our research also have implications for the communication of climate change adaptation policies. Our results show that framing the costs of reducing CO2 emissions in terms of a decrease in future gain—rather than as an opportunity-cost—renders people more willing to commit to climate change initiatives.In summary, this programme of research has taken an integrated and rigorous step towards greater understanding of some of the psychological drivers of individual adaptation to climate change. Given the complexity of the problem, more research is needed, however we believe that our research provides a good early step in this direction.Please cite as: Unsworth, K, Russell, S, Lewandowsky, S, Lawrence, C, Fielding, K, Heath, J, Evans, A, Hurlstone, M, &amp; McNeill, I 2013 What about me?

This tool can now be used to understand the effects of both adaptive and maladaptive coping and to understand what leads to these different ways of coping.Next, we examined adaptive capacity. We found that adaptive coping strategies were associated with perceiving climate change as a threat to oneself and one’s way of life, rating environmental goals as important, and believing that adaptive behaviours could help achieve significant personal goals. Furthermore, when looking at societal adaptive capacity (support for governmental policies) we found that not only were a threat appraisal, climate change or environmental goal, and goal connectedness related to support, but also political affiliation, perceived human contribution to climate change, (lack of) denying that climate change exists, and a number of emotions (enthusiasm, worry, (lack of) happiness, and (lack of ) embarrassment). By knowing these factors that lead to adaptive coping and support for adaptive policies we can identify strategies to improve individual adaptive capacity.Third, based on a range of psychological literature, we hypothesised that adaptive behaviour would be related to goals, goal connectedness, adaptive coping, beliefs about climate change (including denial), and emotions that create an uneasy state of activation (enthusiasm and hope combined with worry). We found support for each of these relationships. Thus, we can again identify strategies to increase adaptive climate change behaviour.&nbsp;Across the studies, we found that adaptive capacity and adaptive behaviours relied upon both “green” beliefs and goals and “non-green” beliefs and goals. Moreover, believing that the adaptive behaviours helped a person to achieve their goals (whether they were related to climate change or not) was strongly related to adaptive capacity and behaviour. We have therefore shown that we can improve adaptation not only in those people who want to help the environment but also in those who are less interested.Unfortunately, the goal structure of environmental goals appears difficult to change. However, making people think about politics did have an effect: Regardless of their own political orientation, a person’s belief about the degree of human contribution to climate change decreased when they were thinking about politics (compared to not thinking about politics). This has implications for how climate change adaptation is discussed in the media and by researchers.The results of our research also have implications for the communication of climate change adaptation policies. Our results show that framing the costs of reducing CO2 emissions in terms of a decrease in future gain—rather than as an opportunity-cost—renders people more willing to commit to climate change initiatives.In summary, this programme of research has taken an integrated and rigorous step towards greater understanding of some of the psychological drivers of individual adaptation to climate change. Given the complexity of the problem, more research is needed, however we believe that our research provides a good early step in this direction"
749,Increasing the resilience of the Australian alpine flora to climate change,"&nbsp;The alpine region around Australia’s highest mountain, Mt Kosciuszko, is part of one of the three most at risk ecosystems in Australia from climate change. With higher temperatures and decreased precipitation, snow cover is already declining with even greater reductions predicted in the short to medium term (2020 to 2050). Consequently the distribution of many native plants and animals may contract, while the distribution of weeds and feral animals may expand. Wildfires in the region are also likely to be more frequent and intense.&nbsp;To contribute to our understanding of how changes in the environment alter plant composition and ecological process, we conducted a series of functional trait analyses of existing composition datasets. We collected trait data in the field for 220 species including canopy height, leaf area, leaf dry matter content and specific leaf area (SLA). Variation in traits among the alpine flora was not related to species distributional ranges. Traits were strongly associated with growth forms, with shrubs often taller than herbs and graminoids, but often had small, tough, long-lasting leaves.&nbsp;Species traits were combined with relative cover values to calculate community trait weighted means, a commonly used measure of functional diversity. Functional diversity varied with altitude/duration of snow cover. For example, shrubs which are taller with small tough leaves dominated lower altitude summits, while at higher altitude summits, large, soft leaved herbs and graminoids dominated. Late lying snowpatches areas with short growing seasons were dominated by low growing herbs and graminoids with small leaves while areas with longer growing seasons were dominated by herbs and graminoids that were taller and had larger leaves.&nbsp;Recovery from fire differed among plant communities. The composition and functional diversity of recovering tall alpine herbfield is trending towards that of equivalent unburnt sites, while burnt windswept feldmark was colonised by graminoids and herbs that are often found in tall alpine herbfield species, with limited shrub recovery in the first nine years post fire.&nbsp;Grazing by feral hares had no effect on composition or functional diversity, while vegetation recovering from cattle grazing showed clear changes in composition and functional diversity even 43 years later. Prioritising management for this high value conservation region, therefore, involves enhancing resilience by minimising existing threats, particularly those from fire, weeds and hard-hooved grazing animals which will be exacerbate by climate change.Please cite as: Pickering, C, &amp; Venn, S, 2013 Increasing the resilience of the Australian flora to climate change and associated threats: a plant functional traits approach National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility, Gold Coast, pp. 94&nbsp;Abstract&nbsp;The alpine region around Australia’s highest mountain, Mt Kosciuszko, is part of one of the three most at risk ecosystems in Australia from climate change.

750,Predicting water quality and ecological responses,"Abstract

Changes to climate are predicted to have effects on freshwater streams. Stream flows are likely to change, with implications for freshwater ecosystems and water quality. Other stressors such as population growth, community preferences and management policies can be expected to interact in various ways with climate change and stream flows, and outcomes for freshwater ecosystems and water quality are uncertain. Managers of freshwater ecosystems and water supplies could benefit from being able to predict the scales of likely changes.

This project has developed and applied a linked modelling framework to assess climate change impacts on water quality regimes and ecological responses. The framework is designed to inform water planning and climate adaptation activities. It integrates quantitative tools, and predicts relationships between future climate, human activities, water quality and ecology, thereby filling a gap left by the considerable research effort so far invested in predicting stream flows.

The modelling framework allows managers to explore potential changes in the water quality and ecology of freshwater systems in response to plausible scenarios for climate change and management adaptations. Although set up for the Upper Murrumbidgee River catchment in southern NSW and ACT, the framework was planned to be transferable to other regions where suitable data are available. The approach and learning from the project appear to have the potential to be broadly applicable.

We selected six climate scenarios representing minor, moderate and major changes in flow characteristics for 1oC and 2oC temperature increases. These were combined with four plausible alternative management adaptations that might be used to modify water supply, urban water demand and stream flow regimes in the Upper Murrumbidgee catchment.

The Bayesian Network (BN) model structure we used was developed using both a ‘top down’ and ‘bottom up’ approach. From analyses combined with expert advice, we identified the causal structure linking climate variables to stream flow, water quality attributes, land management and ecological responses (top down). The ‘bottom up’ approach focused on key ecological outcomes and key drivers, and helped produce efficient models. The result was six models for macroinvertebrates, and one for fish. In the macroinvertebrate BN models, nodes were discretised using statistical/empirical derived thresholds using new techniques.

The framework made it possible to explore how ecological communities respond to changes in climate and management activities. Particularly, we focused on the effects of water quality and quantity on ecological responses. The models showed a strong regional response reflecting differences across 18 regions in the catchment. In two regions the management alternatives were predicted to have stronger effects than climate change. In three other regions the predicted response to climate change was stronger. Analyses of water quality suggested minor changes in the probability of water quality exceeding thresholds designed to protect aquatic ecosystems.

The ‘bottom up’ approach limited the framework’s transferability by being specific to the Upper Murrumbidgee catchment data. Indeed, to meet stakeholder questions models need to be specifically tailored. Therefore the report proposes a general model-building framework for transferring the approach, rather than the models, to other regions.&nbsp;

751,Hauora kotahitanga – Māori health experiences as models for co-operative co-existence between indigenous and non-indigenous people,"The complexities for Māori in creating health and disability  organisations based on their traditional knowledge and practices, when  the institutions and systems they are dealing with for health  developments are non-Māori, are part of the broader phenomenon of  contemporary indigenous knowledge based developments. This thesis  examines the relationships forming between the worlds of Māori and  non-Māori peoples through hauora Māori. The purpose of this study is to  examine Māori experiences of the development and delivery of indigenous  knowledge based hauora Maori models, and to consider these experiences  conceptually as models for kotahitanga (co-operative co-existence)  between indigenous and non-indigenous peoples. The five hauora Maori organisations studied were created during the  1990s to implement matauranga (Māori knowledge) through tikanga (Māori  methodologies), and were inclusive of non-Māori, both as service  providers and service receivers. The experiences of the five case study  organisations are considered within the historical, political, policy  and health sectoral contexts that influence Māori health development. The research methods are grounded in matauranga Maori through an  approach called Kareretanga, developed for this study and based on  traditional forms of knowledge gathering and dissemination.  Kareretangacharacterises and frames the experiences of hauora Maori  practitioners, Māori and non-Māori, in developing and delivering hauora  Māori. The matauranga of Māori scholars guides the study methodology  which focuses on three debates from the indigenous health development  literature: indigeneity; constructive engagement between indigenous and  non-indigenous peoples; and, matauranga for health developments. The findings illustrate multiple hauora Māori initiatives for  community development that are conceptualised as models for kotahitanga  between indigenous and non-indigenous peoples. The experiences of the  hauora Maori organisations studied have been conceptualised in this  study as multiple examples of kotahitanga between Māori and non-Māori  peoples; based on living together differently through indigeneity-based  hauora Māori organisations. The research concluded that ensuring the  inclusion of indigenous knowledge in contemporary health developments  not only underpins indigenous sustainability and resilience, it also  provides indigenous peoples with a platform to participate in national  and global developments in ways that can build the sustainability and  resilience of indigenous and non-indigenous peoples together"
752,"My country, mine country: Indigenous people, mining and development contestation in remote Australia","Agreements between the mining  industry and Indigenous people are not creating sustainable economic  futures for Indigenous people, and this demands consideration of  alternate forms of economic engagement in order to realise such  ‘futures’. Within the context of three mining agreements in north  Australia this study considers Indigenous livelihood aspirations and  their intersection with sustainable development agendas. The three  agreements are the Yandi Land Use Agreement in the Central Pilbara in  Western Australia, the Ranger Uranium Mine Agreement in the Kakadu  region of the Northern Territory, and the Gulf Communities Agreement in  relation to the Century zinc mine in the southern Gulf of Carpentaria in  Queensland. Recent shifts in Indigenous policy in  Australia seek to de-emphasise the cultural behaviour or imperatives of  Indigenous people in undertaking economic action, in favour of a  mainstream conventional approach to economic development. Concepts of  ‘value’, ‘identity’, and ‘community’ are key elements in the tension  between culture and economics that exists in the Indigenous policy  environment. Whilst significant diversity exists within the Indigenous  polity, Indigenous aspirations for the future typically emphasise a  desire for alternate forms of economic engagement that combine elements  of the mainstream economy with the maintenance and enhancement of  Indigenous institutions and ‘livelihood’ activities. Such aspirations  reflect ongoing and dynamic responses to modernity, and typically  concern the interrelated issues of access to and management of  ‘country’, the maintenance of Indigenous institutions associated with  family and kin, access to resources such as cash and vehicles, the  establishment of robust representative organisations, and are integrally  linked to the derivation of both symbolic and economic value of  livelihood pursuits"
753,Broadacre farmers adapting to a changing climate,"Abstract&nbsp;Data on the financial performance of a diverse set of 249 farm businesses in south-western Australia over the period 2002 to 2011 was collated and analysed. &nbsp;These 10 years were a period of challenging weather years, underpinned by a warming and drying trend in the region’s climate, frost events and marked price volatility.Based on a range of metrics, almost two-thirds (64%) of the farms in the sample were classed as growing or strong. A less secure group of farms that are at some potential financial risk formed 15% of the farm sample. Over the study period farm profitability, on average, improved, supported by productivity growth, in spite of no underlying improvement in the farmers’ terms of trade. &nbsp;Productivity improvement allowed most farm businesses, especially crop and mixed enterprise farm businesses, to prosper. &nbsp;The pathway to their profitability was not so much by investing in new technologies that may have shifted outwards farms’ production possibilities, but rather through better use of existing technologies, including technologies that offered scale economies. Also farmers’ shift into greater dependence on cropping, especially wheat production, was shown to be a sensible and successful adaptation strategy in many regions of south-western Australia, particularly the northern grainbelt.The unique and particular characteristics of each farm business were the main determinant of their business success. &nbsp;However, a few generalisations apply. &nbsp;Due to seasonal and market conditions during the study period more farms in the northern parts of the grainbelt in south-western Australia fared better. &nbsp;Also farmers whose businesses grew strongly over the study period on average displayed superior management capabilities and choices in many areas of farm management. &nbsp;In addition, these farmers were often more connected to their local community and achieved greater work-life balance.We conclude that as long as broadacre farmers in south-western Australia have on-going access to improved crop varieties and technologies that support the profitable growing of crops, especially wheat; and that they have access to farm management and business education then farmers are likely to be able to adapt to projected climate change. &nbsp;Provided that a farmer’s terms of trade does not become unduly adverse, and that farmers sensibly manage farm debt, then it seems highly likely that farmers who continue to rely on crop production, mostly wheat-growing, will persist as financially sound businesses in most parts of the study region, even in the face of projected climate change.Please cite this report as:Kingwell, R, Anderton, L, Islam, N, Xayavong, V, Wardell-Johnson, A, Feldman, D, Speijers, J 2013 Broadacre farmers adapting to a changing climate, National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility, Gold Coast. pp.171.Data on the financial performance of a diverse set of 249 farm businesses in south-western Australia over the period 2002 to 2011 was collated and analysed. &nbsp;These 10 years were a period of challenging weather years, underpinned by a warming and drying trend in the region’s climate, frost events and marked price volatility.Based on a range of metrics, almost two-thirds (64%) of the farms in the sample were classed as growing or strong.

754,Climate change adaptation strategies for Australian birds,"Abstract

In the first continental analysis of the effects of climate change on a faunal group, we identified that the climate space of 101 Australian terrestrial and inland water bird taxa is likely to be entirely gone by 2085, 16 marine taxa have breeding sites that are predicted to be at least 10% less productive than today, and 55 terrestrial taxa are likely to be exposed to more frequent or intense fires.&nbsp;

Birds confined to Cape York Peninsula, the Wet Tropics, the Top End of the Northern Territory (particularly the Tiwi Islands), the arid zone, King Island and southern South Australia (particularly Kangaroo Island) are most likely to lose climate space. There was some variation in the predictions of the 18 climate models deployed, but all predicted that the rainforest avifauna of Cape York Peninsula is likely to face the strongest challenge from climate change, particularly taxa currently confined to the Iron and McIlwraith Ranges. For marine birds, those nesting on Lord Howe and Norfolk Islands, the Great Barrier Reef and the Houtman Abrolhos are likely to face the greatest declines in local marine productivity. Changes in local marine productivity may also affect the endemic terrestrial birds of these islands, for which no climate modelling was possible. A small group of beach-nesting and saltmarsh birds may be affected by sea level rise.&nbsp;

Many taxa, and particularly seabirds, are potentially highly sensitive to climate change based on a set of ecological and morphological metrics. Small island taxa were most likely to be both exposed and sensitive to climate change, followed by marine and shoreline taxa. While threatened birds were more likely than non-threatened taxa to be exposed or sensitive to climate change, or both, a substantial proportion was neither.

A key action that needs to be undertaken immediately is fine scale modelling of regions identified as having numerous highly exposed bird taxa, in order to identify climatic refugia within the landscape. Such refugia can then be secured and managed appropriately for the future. The most urgent ongoing action is monitoring, with support for the Atlas of Australian Birds seen as a particularly cost-effective investment. In the future, the most expensive actions will be management of refugia, and captive breeding should all other approaches to conservation in the wild fail. However, most of those for which captive breeding is recommended as a last resort are subspecies of species that are widespread, either in Australia or in New Guinea.&nbsp;

For in situ management, the most important actions will be those that are already important – fire management, weed and feral animal control and, for marine taxa, controls on fishing. A small number of species-specific actions are suggested, and there appears to be no urgent requirement for corridors for the maintenance of taxa likely to be threatened with extinction – those few taxa not already living in areas where there are likely to be refugia will require assistance to colonise new climate space.

The cost of management over the next 50 years for persistence in the face of climate change of the 396 bird taxa that are very highly exposed, sensitive or both is estimated at $18.8 million per year – $47,700 per year for each taxon. The biggest ongoing costs are monitoring and direct species management but refugia management and captive breeding may eventually be needed, and will be much more expensive.

755,Valuing adaptation under rapid change,"AbstractThe methods used to plan adaptation to climate change have been heavily influenced by scientific narratives of gradual change and economic narratives of marginal adjustments to that change. An investigation of the theoretical aspects of how the climate changes suggests that scientific narratives of climate change are socially constructed, biasing scientific narratives to descriptions of gradual as opposed rapid, non-linear change. Evidence of widespread step changes in recent climate records and in model projections of future climate is being overlooked because of this. Step-wise climate change has the potential to produce rapid increases in extreme events that can cross institutional, geographical and sectoral domains.Likewise, orthodox economics is not well suited to the deep uncertainty faced under climate change, requiring a multi-faceted approach to adaptation. The presence of tangible and intangible values range across five adaptation clusters: goods; services; capital assets and infrastructure; social assets and infrastructure; and natural assets and infrastructure. Standard economic methods have difficulty in giving adequate weight to the different types of values across these clusters. They also do not account well for the inter-connectedness of impacts and subsequent responses between agents in the economy. As a result, many highly-valued aspects of human and environmental capital are being overlooked.Recent extreme events are already pressuring areas of public policy, and national strategies for emergency response and disaster risk reduction are being developed as a consequence. However, the potential for an escalation of total damage costs due to rapid change requires a coordinated approach at the institutional level, involving all levels of government, the private sector and civil society.One of the largest risks of maladaptation is the potential for un-owned risks, as risks propagate across domains and responsibility for their management is poorly allocated between public and private interests, and between the roles of the individual and civil society. Economic strategies developed by the disaster community for disaster response and risk reduction provide a base to work from, but many gaps remain.We have developed a framework for valuing adaptation that has the following aspects: the valuation of impacts thus estimating values at risk, the evaluation of different adaptation options and strategies based on cost, and the valuation of benefits expressed as a combination of the benefits of avoided damages and a range of institutional values such as equity, justice, sustainability and profit.The choice of economic methods and tools used to assess adaptation depends largely on the ability to constrain uncertainty around problems (predictive uncertainty) and solutions (outcome uncertainty). Orthodox methods can be used where both are constrained, portfolio methodologies where problems are constrained and robust methodologies where solutions are constrained. Where both are unconstrained, process-based methods utilising innovation methods and adaptive management are most suitable. All methods should involve stakeholders where possible.Innovative processes methods that enable transformation will be required in some circumstances, to allow institutions, sectors and communities to prepare for anticipated major change.Please cite this report as: Jones, RN, Young, CK, Handmer, J, Keating, A, Mekala, GD, Sheehan, P 2013 Valuing adaptation under rapid change, National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility, Gold Coast, pp. 192.The methods used to plan adaptation to climate change have been heavily influenced by scientific narratives of gradual change and economic narratives of marginal adjustments to that change.

756,Enhancing climate change communication: strategies for profiling and targeting Australian interpretive communities,"Abstracthis research aimed to provide practical information about how to design communications on climate change adaptation and target these to the Australian population. &nbsp; This was achieved by: (1) identifying and increasing awareness of different climate change audiences in Australia, and (2) evaluating how each audience responds to different types of climate change messages.&nbsp;Phase 1 of the study used audience segmentation analysis to identify the main climate change interpretive communities within Australia; that is, groups of Australians who share similar views and understandings about climate change. &nbsp; A nationwide sample consisting of 3,096 Australian residents (aged 15 to 108 years, 47% male and 53% female) completed an online survey assessing a broad range of psychological and behavioural factors related to climate change. &nbsp; Latent profile analysis applied to the psychological variables suggested that this Australian sample consists of five distinct interpretive communities: Alarmed (26%), Concerned (39%), Uncertain (14%), Doubtful (12%), and Dismissive (9%). Validation analyses revealed that these groups differed in terms of how they responded to perceived climate change threats, and also in their support for particular climate change mitigation and adaptation policies. &nbsp;&nbsp;Phase 2 of the project examined how Australian interpretive communities respond to climate change adaptation messages and identified the specific message attributes that drive these responses. 1,031 Australian residents (aged 18 to 66 years, 49.8% male, 50.2% female) completed an online survey assessing a similar set of psychological and behavioural responses to climate change to those assessed in Phase 1. &nbsp; Respondents subsequently viewed six climate change adaptation messages that were randomly allocated from a pool of 60 messages sourced from the internet. &nbsp; Messages were pre-coded on 10 communication cues (e.g., language complexity, normative influence), and respondents rated them on four judgement dimensions: perceived threat, perceived efficacy, fear control (message rejection), and danger control (message acceptance). &nbsp;&nbsp;Latent profile analysis applied to the psychological variables identified three climate change interpretive communities in this sample: Alarmed (34.4%), Uncommitted (45.2%), and Dismissive (20.3%). &nbsp; Judgement analysis methodology (Cooksey, 1996) found that the three interpretive communities based their threat and efficacy evaluations on unique combinations of communication cues, and that high perceived threat and high perceived efficacy were related to message acceptance for all communities. &nbsp;&nbsp;Effective messages for Dismissive respondents used simple language and did not emphasise descriptive social norms. &nbsp;&nbsp;Uncommitted audience members responded positively to messages that focused on preventing losses and had a strong emotional component. &nbsp;&nbsp;Alarmed respondents preferred messages that focused on local issues and had a collectivist frame.&nbsp;Providing specific adaptation advice in messages was found to be effective for all communities. The results largely support the Extended Parallel Processing Model of risk communication (Witte, 1992), and suggest that message attributes should be adjusted to effectively communicate with different climate change interpretive communities within Australia.Please cite this report as:Hine, D, Phillips, W, Reser, J, Cooksey, R, Marks, A, Nunn, P, Watt, S, Ellul, M 2013 Enhancing climate change communication: Strategies for profiling and targeting Australian interpretive communities, National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility, Gold Coast, pp. 95.his research aimed to provide practical information about how to design communications on climate change adaptation and target these to the Australian population. &nbsp; This was achieved by: (1) identifying and increasing awareness of different climate change audiences in Australia, and (2) evaluating how each audience responds to different types of climate change messages.&nbsp;Phase 1 of the study used audience segmentation analysis to identify the main climate change interpretive communities within Australia; that is, groups of Australians who share similar views and understandings about climate change. &nbsp; A nationwide sample consisting of 3,096 Australian residents (aged 15 to 108 years, 47% male and 53% female) completed an online survey assessing a broad range of psychological and behavioural factors related to climate change. &nbsp; Latent profile analysis applied to the psychological variables suggested that this Australian sample consists of five distinct interpretive communities: Alarmed (26%), Concerned (39%), Uncertain (14%), Doubtful (12%), and Dismissive (9%).

757,Mitigating impacts of climate change in stream food webs,"AbstractUnderstanding the effects of changing climates on the processes which support aquatic biodiversity is of critical importance for managing aquatic ecosystems. This research used an experimental approach to determine whether there are potential ecological surprises in terms of threshold relationships between climate and critical aquatic processes. These results were then placed in the context of the potential for riparian replanting to mitigate against these impacts.A review was carried out of climate change experiments in freshwaters, and revealed that the vast majority of studies have failed to take into account predicted increases in the frequency of extreme events (such as heatwaves) on biota. In order to include these components of changes in climate, a methodology was developed for downscaling global circulation models of climate change to generate realistic temperature data to use as an experimental treatment. Stream communities from the field were brought into experimental flumes and warmed according to the predictions of the down-scaled climate change models. Experiments were run for six weeks and responses were measured for basal processes (algal productivity and carbon dynamics) and aquatic invertebrate communities. Basal processes showed relatively small responses to the changed temperature regime, and appear to be relatively resistant for warming on the scale predicted under climate change scenarios for the next century. Aquatic invertebrate communities did show some responses, but these tended to be in terms of changes in size structure withion particular taxa rather than major impacts on patterns of biodiversity.The largest effects were seen for emerging adults of aquatic insects, were all species in the community responded in some way to our 2100 climate change treatment. Responses were species- and sex-specific. Males of all mayfly species emerged faster under 2100 temperatures compared to 1990-2000 temperatures. For the mayfly Ulmerophlebia pipinna (Leptophlebiidae), this implied a change in the sex ratio that could potentially compromise populations and, ultimately, lead to local extinctions. Furthermore, our results show a decrease in the overall community body size (average across taxa) due to a shift from bigger to smaller species.These results are in accord with the ecological rules dealing with the temperature-size relationships (in particular, Bergmann’s rule). Studies of streams in the field revealed that riparian vegetation did cool stream temperatures, and that the presence of riparian vegetation, ideally with extensive vegetation cover across the catchment, did appear to maintain higher diversity and abundance in stream invertebrate communities. Therefore it seems that restoring riparian vegetation does represent an effective means of adaptation to changing climates for temperate south eastern Australian freshwaters.Please cite this report as: Thompson, RM, Beardall, J, Beringer, J, Grace, M, Sardina, P 2013 Mitigating impacts of climate change on stream food webs: impacts of elevated temperature and CO2 on the critical processes underpinning resilience of aquatic ecosystems National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility, Gold Coast, pp.136.Understanding the effects of changing climates on the processes which support aquatic biodiversity is of critical importance for managing aquatic ecosystems.

758,Pre-service teachers use e-learning technologies to enhance their learning,"The purpose of this study was twofold. The primary purpose was to improve pre-service teacher education by using technology to help pre-service teachers bridge the gap between academic preparation and practice. The secondary, but still important, objective was to familiarize pre-service teachers in the use of technology to support their future pedagogical activities. Therefore, this research sought to develop a method for training undergraduate students in designing, implementing, and evaluating lesson plans to solidify the relationship between research, pedagogy, and teaching practice. Specifically, this study investigated the implementation of e-learning as a method of instruction to help pre-service teachers evaluate and improve upon the implementation of their lesson plans during their real world practicum experiences. The study was guided by the following research questions: 1) What successes, challenges, and benefits do university instructors and pre-service teachers experience in using and analyzing video in teacher education methods coursework? 2) In what ways did the use of e-learning help the pre-service teachers improve their teaching during the practicum experience? Results showed that participants reported improved lesson planning, improved lesson implementation, visual interpretations of best practices, modeling, and peer and university instructor feedback as successes of the e-learning project. Challenges included participants’ frustrations of being overworked and overwhelmed with the technical problems associated with e-learning. Overall participants judged the e-learning project as a very positive aspect of their teacher training"
759,Impact of climate change on disadvantaged groups: issues and interventions,"Abstract

In the international literature on climate change there is an emerging concern that the negative effects of climate change will be disproportionately experienced by those who are economically and socially disadvantaged, further widening the gap between them and more advantaged population groups. However, the relationship between climate change impact and social disadvantage remains little investigated. This study has sought to contribute to this gap by adding to the small body of empirical knowledge of the vulnerability and adaptive capacity of disadvantaged groups in Australia in the face of impending adverse impacts of climate change.

The study provides a discussion of the historical and future climate trends and its implications for the population. However, it goes on to discuss the concept of social vulnerability in the international literature and to show that at the local level population vulnerability to climate change is more likely to be defined by the socio-economic differences in the community, than by environmental impact.

Adding to the wide discussion of the concept and operationalization of climate vulnerability this study adapted an approach of developing a measure of social exclusion as a way of measuring social vulnerability and adaptive capacity. The study uses ABS 2011 Population Census data to measure social vulnerability at LGA level. It also uses quantitative data collected from 1800 CATI interviews in three contrasting communities in South Australia (Port Pirie, Port Adelaide Enfield and Berri/Barmera), as well as qualitative data from 57 in-depth face-to-face interviews with disadvantaged households, and 13 interviews with the main stakeholders in these LGAs.

Using ABS 2011 Census data, the study maps separate indicators, as well as the composite index of social exclusion across the LGAs in South Australia to identify the areas with the highest level of social exclusion. It then uses the concept of social exclusion to study vulnerability of disadvantaged groups to the impact of climate change at household level.

The results of the quantitative and qualitative data analyses provide a deeper understanding of the characteristics of social exclusion among disadvantaged groups, as well as of the associations between disadvantage, social exclusion and vulnerability of households in South Australia. The implications of these findings are discussed in the context of potential policy interventions to enhance resilience and decrease the negative impacts of climate change for disadvantaged groups.

760,"Joining the dots: hydrology, freshwater ecosystem values and adaptation options","AbstractThe objective of this research was to investigate and test the necessary steps in developing an adaptation planning framework for freshwater biodiversity. We used Tasmania as a test case to demonstrate how downscaled climate model outputs could be integrated with spatially resolved hydrological models and freshwater biodiversity data. This enabled us to scope adaptation actions at local, regional and state scales for Tasmania, and to explore how priorities might be set.To achieve this integration we quantified how different climate change scenarios could affect the risks to biodiversity and ecosystem values (‘biodiversity assets’) in freshwaters, the scope and types of adaptation actions, and assessed the strengths and weaknesses of the policy and planning instruments in responding to climate change.We concluded that downscaled climate modelling, linked with modelling of catchment and hydrological processes, refines projections for climate-driven risks to aquatic environments. Spatial and temporal hazards and risks can now be compared at a variety of scales, as well as comparisons between biodiversity assets (e.g. relative risk to riparian vegetation v. in-stream biota). Uncertainties can be identified and built into adaptation processes. Notwithstanding this progress, we identified a number of issues that need to be addressed in order to increase confidence in this process.The main issues for improved and timely modelling are: frameworks for using and downscaling outputs from improved global climate models as they become available; better data on thermal tolerances of freshwater biota; and, improved methods for predicting key water temperature variables from air temperature and other biophysical predictors. Improvements are also needed in updating and maintaining high quality biodiversity data sets, and better spatially explicit information on the contributions of groundwater to surface waters and rates of recharge.The list of adaptation options available is extensive, but the key challenge is to organise these options so that stakeholders are not overwhelmed.  Scenario modelling that incorporates explicit tools for comparing costs, benefits, feasibility and social acceptability should help with setting priorities but require further development.A review of current Australian policies revealed a variety of responses driven by both water reform and climate change agendas. Many agencies are actively revising their policies to accommodate adaptation. However, we note that much of the reform of the water sector in the last 10–15 years has aimed to improve certainty for non-environmental water uses. Under the National Water Initiative, governments have agreed that entitlement holders should bear the risks of reduced volumes or reliability of their water allocations as a result of changes in climate. The key opportunity for adaptive uptake of climate adaptations is by developing and periodically reviewing water management planning tools. Pathways need to be developed for integrating the traditional evolution of planning and policy with the needs for climate change adaptation for aquatic ecosystems. Formal mechanisms for the uptake of knowledge about identified risks into policy and legislative instruments remain under-developed. An even bigger challenge is to integrate multiple adaptation strategies (sometimes at different scales) to achieve specific adaptation objectives within regions or catchments—especially where a mix of water management and non-water management is required"
761,Understanding the adaptive capacity of Australian small-to-medium enterprises to climate change and variability,"Abstract

Small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) comprise 96 per cent of all private businesses in Australia. The SME sector is the economy’s largest employer and the largest contributor to GDP. Moreover, SMEs play a significant role within socio-economic systems: they provide employment, goods and services and tax revenue for communities. Climate change may result in adverse business outcomes including business interruptions, increased investment and insurance costs, and declines in financial indicators such as measures of value, return and growth. After natural disasters, SMEs face greater short-term losses than larger enterprises, and may have lower adaptive capacity for various reasons. This study examines the underlying factors and processes shaping adaptive capacity of Australian SMEs’ to climate change and associated sea level rise. Specifically, the research asks the following questions: 1) How have SMEs considered and integrated adaptation into business planning? 2) What are the key underlying processes that constrain and influence the adaptive capacities of SMEs? and 3) What types of support are required to promote SME business continuity under a changing climate? The study adopts theories from Political Ecology and draws on literature on vulnerability and hazards to understand the processes that mediate the adaptive capacity of SMEs. The empirical research involved an online survey targeting SMEs, attending business engagement events hosted by chambers of commerce, 30 semi-structured interviews with secondary stakeholders, five case studies involving SMEs and secondary stakeholders, and finally a stakeholder workshop which brought together participants from both groups.

The central conclusion of this study is that underlying contextual processes are critical to enhancing the adaptive capacity of SMEs. These processes include: the social relationships between SMEs and support organisations; the relationships within support organisations themselves; the agency of SMEs to direct resources toward building resilience into business continuity; SMEs’ perceptions of climate risks; and power struggles between support organisations. Unfavourable combinations of these processes have the potential to limit the adaptive choices that SMEs can adopt in order to overcome climate change and other related stresses on business continuity. These processes generate vulnerability and often occur at scales external to the SMEs;including relationships between different tiers of government as well as between various support organisations working with SMEs. These contextual processes have been largely overlooked in formal programmes that aim to build business resilience. The programmes have tended to be reactive and have tended to focus on business recovery during and after disasters rather than on altering the vulnerability context of SMEs through anticipatory prevention and preparedness or adaptation planning. This study suggests that the success of efforts to build the adaptive capacity of SMEs to future climate and related stresses will depend on how they address these underlying processes to facilitate the ability of SMEs to exercise their agency in pursuing adaptive choices that they value"

763,Adaptive management of Ramsar wetlands,"Abstract

The Macquarie Marshes are one of Australia’s iconic wetlands, recognised for their international importance, providing habitat for some of the continent’s more important waterbird breeding sites as well as complex and extensive flood-dependent vegetation communities. Part of the area is recognised as a wetland of international importance, under the Ramsar Convention. River regulation has affected their resilience, which may increase with climate change. Counteracting these impacts, the increased amount of environmental flow provided to the wetland through the buy-back and increased wildlife allocation have redressed some of the impacts of river regulation.

This project assists in the development of an adaptive management framework for this Ramsar-listed wetland. It brings together current management and available science to provide an informed hierarchy of objectives that incorporates climate change adaptation and assists transparent management. The project adopts a generic approach allowing the framework to be transferred to other wetlands, including Ramsar-listed wetlands, supplied by rivers ranging from highly regulated to free flowing.

The integration of management with science allows key indicators to be monitored that will inform management and promote increasingly informed decisions. The project involved a multi-disciplinary team of scientists and managers working on one of the more difficult challenges for Australia, exacerbated by increasing impacts of climate change on flows and inundation patterns"
764,Climate change adaptation and the rental sector,"AbstractThe research employed an asset-based approach to understanding the capacities, assets and skills which tenants, landlords and housing managers bring to climate change adaptation. The project also took a pro-poor approach focusing on the adaptive capacity of low-income renters in the public and private sectors, addressing the equity dimensions of vulnerability and adaptation. In addition to analysing a range of secondary sources such as media articles, ‘green’ guides and policy documents, the research analysed primary data from interviews and focus groups, focusing on:The assets of the rental sector in adaptationBarriers which limit the capacity of individuals and organisations to exercise these assetsThe relationships between the stakeholders – tenants, landlords and property managers – which underlie both assets and barriers to adaptation.We found that the tenants we interviewed were motivated by concern about the impact of human activity on the environment, and exercised this concern through everyday sustainable household practices, as well as through engagement with community or political organisations. They believed however that their capacity to act in the home was inhibited by a lack of care from some landlords and property managers about the sustainability of rental housing.Public housing managers who were interviewed positioned the public housing sector as policy leaders in sustainability and adaptation, but as constrained by a lack of resources (human and financial) and the busy reactive nature of their work. &nbsp;Busyness and lack of resources was also seen as a constraint on private property managers’ capacity to advocate or arrange for sustainability modifications to the properties they managed. Property managers emerged as crucial ‘knowledge brokers’ mediating between landlords and tenants, but expressed a need for more information and training. Both tenants and property managers acknowledged that the current shortage of rental housing in many areas was one of the most important constraints on tenants’ ability to influence the market through preference for more adaptive and sustainable housing.&nbsp;The interviews and focus groups with tenants and property managers mapped out a strong asset base in the rental sector including: tenants’ strong visions for the future; property managers’ understandings of the tenant/landlord/property manager relationships, legislation, costing and procurement processes; organisational and community networks; and existing adaptive capacity already evident in the everyday practices.The research report makes recommendations in the following areas:increased support for an enhanced role for property managers as advocates and knowledge brokers for sustainability and adaptationincentives and education for landlords to see investment properties as ‘ethical investments’ to enable tenants to adapt to climate changeincreased overall supply of rental housing, particularly affordable rental housingincreased assets for tenants to enable investments of time and money in a secure ‘home’changes to tenancy conditions and better communication with landlordsgovernment action on regulatory change to support the above changes, including action on housing supply and a review of rental building sustainability standards.Please cite this report as:Instone, L, Mee, K, Palmer, J, Williams, M, Vaughan, N 2013 Climate change adaptation and the rental sector, National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility, Gold Coast, pp. 200.AbstractThe research employed an asset-based approach to understanding the capacities, assets and skills which tenants, landlords and housing managers bring to climate change adaptation.

765,Managing coextinction of insects in a changing climate,"AbstractApproximately a quarter of global terrestrial biodiversity is represented by plant dwelling insects and the potential for thousands of species to be extinguished through widespread disturbances such as a changing climate is high. From a large database of 1,019 insect species on 104 plant species, we identified that 70 species were of immediate conservation concern due to their reliance on threatened plant species. A further 15 insect species were of lesser conservation concern because they rely on several threatened plant species for survival. Of those insects that feed from non-threatened plant species, 178 host-specific species are likely to be at risk in the event that climate change or synergistic factors reduces their host plant’s range size. Insect groups that appear most prone to extinction are sessile feeders and highly host specific groups such as whiteflies, scales, mealybugs. Many weevils are also host specific and at higher risk, possibly as they are dispersal inhibited, such as through brachyptery. More surprisingly, mobile plant louse groups (Psylloidea) were also at high risk. Endophagous insects are predicted to be at high risk, but were under-studied here.Regions such as gullies and mountains provide refugia for some species. The fluctuations in temperature (less within refugia), and average humidity (higher in refugia) appear particularly important in these habitats. Particular vegetation types are associated with refugial regions, with a recognised Threatened Ecological Community (TEC) of flora species associated with the highest peaks of the Eastern Mastif, and there is evidence of insect species restricted to these peaks. For the majority of plant species that are not restricted to certain areas, their insect assemblages differ significantly between plant populations, particularly across different mountains.With the assistance of end-users, we have developed an adaptation management framework. The framework assists with conserving plant-dwelling insect species, after they are identified as in need of conservation action. Whilst the primary reason for the development of the framework was to provide adaptation actions in the face of climate change, the framework can be used when insects require conservation action to ameliorate impacts of other threatening processes. Previously published frameworks can be utilized to determine whether an insect is threatened with extinction. Despite the availability of such tools, a survey of end-users still indicted that lack of expertise is the most important factor inhibiting considering plant-dwelling insects.Land managers currently struggle to determine which insect species inhabit their lands, let alone knowing which are in need of conservation. To assist land managers with these problems, we suggest the employment of dedicated conservation entomologists by the Federal and State governments. Their role would be to bridge the interface between taxonomists, government conservation bodies, land managers and disturbance ecologists. The conservation entomologist’s principle tasks would be to identify insects most at risk of extinction, nominate them for listing, and develop management plans to ensure their survival"
766,Barriers to adaptation to sea-level rise,"Abstract

Increasingly there is recognition from researchers and policy makers that there are legal, institutional and cultural barriers to climate change adaptation that will need to be addressed if we are able to adapt efficiently and equitably. However, there is a limited body of evidence and few examples of how barriers to adaptation to sea level rise emerge and are addressed in local contexts. Focusing on sea level rise in Australia, this project undertakes inquiry into legal, institutional and cultural barriers to adaptation in two ways. The first is an investigation of barriers to climate change adaptation in general by analysing a unique body of evidence in a systematic document analysis of over eight hundred pages of submissions to the Australian Productivity Commission’s inquiry to barriers to adaptation. The second was an in-depth investigation into community perceptions of one particular barrier - uncertainty about responsibility for adaptation - in two case study areas: Eurobodalla in New South Wales and Mornington Peninsula in Victoria.

The study found that, according to key actors in climate change adaptation in Australia, there are 5 five key kinds of barriers to adaptation: governance, policy, uncertainty, resources, and psychosocial factors. The governance barrier of uncertainty about roles and responsibilities across levels of government and sectors was seen to be one of the most important barriers to adaptation. The subsequent empirical research into community preferences for the distribution of responsibility for key adaptation tasks revealed that there was strong support for a significant role for government in all aspects of adaptation. There is recognition that adaptation to sea level rise should be a shared responsibility, but with distinct roles for each level of government. Local government was seen to be best placed to manage public assets, regulate decisions about private assets, and lead and coordinate public input for local planning. Federal government was viewed as the most appropriate entity to take responsibility for information provision on the risks of sea level rise, and to bear most of the costs of adaptation. State governments, while not viewed as the primary responsible entity for any of these key tasks, was seen to have a role in coordinating adaptation actions across local government areas"
767,Disaster response and climate change in the Pacific,"AbstractDisasters, and therefore disaster response, in the Pacific are expected to be affected by climate change. This research addressed this issue, and focused on the immediate humanitarian needs following a disaster, drawing upon adaptive capacity as a concept to assess the resilience of individual organisations and the robustness of the broader system of disaster response. Four case study countries (Fiji, Cook Islands, Vanuatu and Samoa) were chosen for deeper investigation of the range of issues present in the Pacific. The research process was guided by a Project Reference Group, which included key stakeholders from relevant organisations involved in Pacific disaster response to guide major decisions of the research process and to influence its progression.Given the complexity of issues involved, including the contested definitions of adaptive capacity, the research team developed a conceptual framework to underpin the research. This framework drew upon concepts from a range of relevant disciplines including Earth System Governance, climate change adaptation, health resources, resilience in institutions and practice theory. Objective and subjective determinants of adaptive capacity were used to assess the ‘disaster response system’, comprised of actors and agents from government and non-government sectors, and the governance structures, policies, plans and formal and informal networks that support them.Results revealed the most important determinant of adaptive capacity in the Pacific to be communications and relationships, with both informal and formal mechanisms found to be essential. Capacity (including human, financial and technical); leadership, management and governance structures; and risk perceptions were also highly important determinants of adaptive capacity. The research also found that in small Pacific island bureaucracies, responsibility and capacity often rests with individuals rather than organisations. Leadership, trust, informal networks and relationships were found to have a strong influence on the adaptive capacity of organisations and the broader disaster response system.A common finding across all four case study countries affecting adaptive capacity was the limited human resources for health and disaster response more generally, both in times of disaster response and in day-to-day operations. Another common finding was the gap in psychosocial support after a disaster. Water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) as an immediate post-disaster humanitarian need was relatively well established amongst responding organisations (although long term WASH issues were not resolved), while other humanitarian needs (health care, and food and nutrition) had varying stages of capacity – often limited by human, financial and technical resources. Adaptive capacity was therefore constrained by current gaps which need addressing alongside a future focus where risk is changing.Drawing on these and other findings, recommendations for addressing key determinants of adaptive capacity were developed for relevant stakeholder groups including policy makers and practitioners in the disaster and emergency response sectors in Australia and the Pacific"
768,Extreme heat and climate change: adaptation in culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) communities,"AbstractBackground: Several overseas studies have identified that people in ethnic minority groups are at greater risk during heatwaves. However, there is a paucity of information on this issue in Australia. With a highly multicultural society, it is important that vulnerable subpopulations and minority groups are recognised and considered in climate change discussions and the formulation of adaptation strategies.Objective: To identify cultural, socioeconomic and linguistic factors affecting vulnerability to heat and climate change in culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) communities, to identify vulnerable subgroups, and where appropriate to recommend ways to increase adaptive capacity.Methods: Interviews and focus groups were conducted with stakeholders from the government sector, non-government organisations, the health sector and CALD communities in Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney. Data were analysed using thematic analysis and framework analysis. A workshop was also held to engage with and seek recommendations from stakeholders.Results: For socio-cultural reasons subgroups within CALD communities do not cope well with Australia’s extreme heat which can differ from heat experienced elsewhere. Those at risk include older migrants and new arrivals, people in new and emerging communities, and low income migrants who lack English proficiency skills. Socioeconomic disadvantage, linguistic barriers, poor quality housing and cultural issues contribute to vulnerability. At present the needs of many are unmet in terms of knowledge about harm minimisation strategies during extreme heat. To facilitate climate change adaptation for the broader population and minimise potential heat health disparities, there needs to be equity in access to resources that can aid in building resilience. This will require a suite of communication tools to cater for Australia’s growing number of residents with diverse cultural, linguistic and religious backgrounds. The social capital existing within networks and the high adaptive capacity of migrants are enablers in the adaptation process.Conclusion: Providing information to new migrants and refugees about climate change risks in Australia and ways to sustain health during extreme heat will assist in overcoming barriers in vulnerable sectors of communities. Promoting social connectedness will also facilitate a more inclusive approach to climate change adaptation. An outcome from this translational research has been an increase in awareness amongst policymakers of the need for broader communication of heat messages"
769,A manifesto for the creative economy,"The UK\u27s creative economy is one of its great national strengths,  historically deeply rooted and accounting for around one-tenth of the  whole economy. It provides jobs for 2.5 million people – more than in  financial services, advanced manufacturing or construction – and in  recent years, this creative workforce has grown four times faster than  the workforce as a whole. But behind this success lies much disruption and business  uncertainty, associated with digital technologies. Previously profitable  business models have been swept away, young companies from outside the  UK have dominated new internet markets, and some UK creative businesses  have struggled to compete. UK policymakers too have failed to keep pace with developments in  North America and parts of Asia. But it is not too late to refresh tired  policies. This manifesto sets out our 10-point plan to bolster one of  the UK\u27s fastest growing sectors"
770,The role of water markets in climate change adaptation,"Abstract

Water markets were first introduced in Australia in the 1980s, and water entitlement and allocation trade have been increasingly adopted by both private individuals and government.Irrigators turned to water markets (particularly for allocation water) to manage water scarcity and Governments to acquire water for the environment (particularly water entitlements. It is expected that further adoption of water markets will be essential for coping with future climate change impacts. This report reviews the available literature related to the relationship between southern Murray-Darling Basin (sMDB) water markets and anticipated climate change effects; the economic, social and environmental impacts of water reallocation through markets; and future development requirements to enhance positive outcomes in these areas.

The use of water markets by irrigators can involve both transformational (selling all water entitlements and relocating or switching to dryland) and incremental (e.g. buying water allocations/entitlements, using carry-over, changing water management techniques) adaptation to climate change. Barriers to both adaptations include: current and future climate uncertainty; poor (or non-existent) market signals; financial constraints; information barriers; mental processing limits; inherent attitudes toward or beliefs about climate change; institutional barriers and disincentives to adapt.

A better understanding of trade behaviour, especially strategic trade issues that can lead to market failures, will improve the economic advantages of water trade. There remains community concerns about the impacts of transfers away from regional areas such as reduced community spending and reinvestment; population losses; loss of jobs; declining taxation base, loss of local services and businesses, regional production changes; and legacy issues for remaining farmers. However, it is hard to disentangle these impacts from those caused by ongoing structural change in agriculture. Rural communities that are most vulnerable to water scarcity under climate change and water trade adjustment include smaller irrigation-dependent towns. Communities less dependent on irrigation are better able to adapt. Further, where environmental managers use water markets to deal with water variability and to ensure ecological benefits, irrigators are concerned about its impact on their traditional use of markets to manage scarcity.

Climate change and water scarcity management are intertwined, suggesting that policy, institutional and governance arrangements to deal with such issues should be similarly structured. Water users will adapt, either out of necessity or opportunity. The cost of that adaptation at individual, regional and national levels—particularly to future water supply variability—can be mitigated by the consideration of the existing advantages from future opportunities for water marketing in Australia"
771,The capacities of private developers in urban climate change adaptation,"AbstractThe urban environment is particularly exposed to climate impacts, due to a range of factors, such as its geographical location, spatial immobility, and high population. The urban development industry relates to climate change because the built environment itself has climate impacts; the location and scale of development products influence the degree to which users are exposed to climate hazards; and climate change presents multiple challenges to which developers will likely need to adapt. However, a major policy and knowledge gap exists in the social scientific understanding of the private sector developers’ capability to respond in an effective and timely way to the climate adaptation challenge. Using South East Queensland (SEQ) as a case study, this research investigated the institutional capacity of the private urban development sector to respond to climate change. This report explores findings from an online questionnaire survey, and a series of interviews and focus groups.In general, the adaptive capacity of SEQ development industry is dependent on a combination of complex and interconnected factors, such as: financing and market conditions; government regulation and industry self-regulation; firm size and structure; the type and spatiotemporal scale of developments; and the concepts of leadership and legacy. These factors could be broadly characterised under the following categories; participant characteristics, internal attributes, development characteristics, regulation, and economic and market characteristics.Development firms with a greater adaptive capacity were generally larger, with greater economic resources, and were less reliant on bank funding. They also had a diverse range of development products, and could afford to hire or contract specialist consultants. Commercial developers were also more likely to incorporate adaptive measures into developments than were residential developers. This was driven by tenant demand, government rebates, and reduced operating and maintenance costs. Commercial developers also subscribed to industry certification and rating schemes such as Green Star and EnviroDevelopment. On the other hand, residential developers sold rather than leased development products; and reported little, if any demand for sustainable features from the market, which was primarily price driven.The major barriers to adaptive capacity were economic, marketing and regulatory issues. The development economy had not fully recovered from the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). The GFC had also severely curtailed bank lending for property development; financiers required a higher percentage of equity and presales, and required loans to be repaid in less than two years. State and Local Government regulation and processes were also seen as barriers to adaptation; regulation was viewed as reactive, complex, inconsistent and inflexible. The perceived slowness of local government was a particular problem.Generally speaking, the SEQ development industry had low adaptive capacity, but this also depended on the financial, insurance and government players. The insurance and financial sectors had the potential to drive adaptation, but current practices resulted more often in maladaptation. Further research into the role of allied professionals, such as consultants and contractors, would be valuable; as would research into the potential for the insurance industry to drive climate change adaptation"
772,Building the scaffolding: strengthening support for young people in Victoria,"While most young Victorians do well, many face challenges as they  move from childhood to adulthood, including homelessness, mental health  issues, family violence, abuse and neglect, drug and alcohol issues and  involvement in the criminal justice system. One in five young people do  not have anyone in their lives to turn to for help and support.Without appropriate and timely support, these challenges can and do  have lifelong consequences — poorer health and wellbeing, lower  education outcomes and poorer employment prospects, which are not only  damaging for the individual but also costly for the wider community. Providing support for young people can be likened to ‘scaffolding’ —  support that is available to young people as they develop their own  capacities. The level of scaffolding needed changes through the course  of a young person’s life — through early childhood, the middle years (8  to 12 years†), adolescence and early adulthood — and can be built from a  number of supports including families, community networks and schools. This report looks at the role that community sector and government  organisations play in reinforcing this scaffolding and considers how  supports can be further strengthened to promote better outcomes for all  young Victorians.Background The Victorian Council of Social Service (VCOSS) and the Youth Affairs Council of Victoria (YACVic) conducted this research to: identify current gaps in youth support services in Victoriaassess the impact of those gaps on young people’shealth and wellbeingidentify relevant government policies andprogram initiativesidentify solutions or actions to address youth support service needsrecommend policy changes to improve young people’s health and wellbeing. To explore these issues from the perspective of organisations that  provide services to young people, a survey of 213 community, school and  government service providers was undertaken in March 2012. This research was also undertaken at a time of significant government and sector reform in Victoria, including: the implementation of the Community Sector Reform Project which will  consider how the Victorian Government and the service sector work  together to improve the lives of vulnerable Victoriansthe development of a whole of government vulnerable children’s frameworkthe establishment of the Commission for Children and Young Peoplethe piloting of a new holistic case management model, Services Connect within the Department ofHuman Servicesthe Department of Education and Early Childhood Development’s  (DEECD) review of its approach to vulnerable children and young peoplethe ongoing development and evaluation of the DEECD Youth Partnerships modelthe implementation of DEECD’s Towards Victoria as a Learning Community frameworkthe development of a Compact between schools and DEECDsignificant changes to the funding and delivery of Vocational Education and Training (VET)the development of the whole of government Victorian Alcohol and Drug Strategythe reform of the Psychiatric Disability Rehabilitation and Support  Services Programreforms outlined as part of the Victorian Homelessness  Action Planthe Economic Study on Service Delivery Reform and Disadvantagethe introduction of the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) from 1 July 2013 in Barwon, Victoria.Findings The survey of 213 service providers across all local government areas  of Victoria highlighted a number of critical issues that need to be  addressed to strengthen supports for young people. The identification of critical gaps in: specialist services, particularly in housing, flexible education  options, and support for young people with disabilities and mental  health issuespolicies and services for the ‘middle years’, children aged 8 to 12  years, which means they often go unsupported at this critical time,  including the transition from primary to secondary schoolthe availability of generalist youth support servicespublic transport options, particularly in outer metropolitan, rural and regional areasservice availability including: after–hours and weekend support for young peopleservices in population growth areasprogram delivery and staff recruitment in rural and regional Victoria ongoing funding challenges including: funding models that exclude young people by imposing age and eligibility criteriashort term funding that undermines the sustainability of programs  and increases staff turnover which limits relationship development  between young people and workersprescriptive funding criteria that does not allow for a holistic  service response to the diverse range and complexity of issues young  people may experiencethe need for stronger partnerships between all the services that  support young people — youth services, schools, specialist adult support  services and family services — and the need for these partnerships to  be appropriately resourced and coordinatedthe need for stronger and more coordinated needs identification and  strategic service planning at the local, regional and state levelsthe lack of a coordinated approach to evaluation and outcomes measurement.   Findings indicate that five key elements are critical to building a strong service system for children and young people: Support across the life course: adolescence is starting earlier and  finishing later. This shift demands a rethink about how we respond to  children, young people and young adults.Early intervention at every age and stage: a diverse mix of services  can provide support to young people at every age and at every stage of  an issue, from prevention and early invention to more specialist  supports through to crisis support and beyond.Services working collaboratively: youth services must remain at the  heart of the service system for young people, but an integrated response  also requires the expertise of other services such as family support,  adult support services and schools.Accessible and inclusive services: support needs to be accessible,  available when and where young people need it and inclusive of a diverse  range of young people.Supporting improved outcomes: services and supports need to be built  on sound evidence and respond to identified need within communities"
773,Overview of Australian Indigenous health status,"This paper provides information on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations, the context of Indigenous health, various measures of population health status, selected health conditions, and health risk factors.

The main purpose of this report is to provide a comprehensive summary of the most recent indicators of the health of Indigenous people. It is beyond the scope of the Overview to analyse trends in the various indicators, so it tends to draw attention to the current health status of Australia\u27s Indigenous peoples. The report doesn\u27t attempt to review other aspects, such as the availability and use of services (including barriers to their use) and strategies and policies related to specific health topics. Readers interested in these aspects should refer to the topic-specific reviews that are available on the HealthInfoNet\u27s website.

Research for the report involves the collection, collation, and analysis of a wide range of relevant information, including both published and unpublished material. Sources include government reports, particularly those produced by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW), the Australian Health Ministers Advisory Council (AHMAC), and the Steering Committee for the Review of Government Service Provision (SCRGSP).

774,Experiencing out-of-home care in Australia: the views of children and young people,"This survey was designed to provide a reference point for how the out-of-home care system is faring in 2013 from the point of view of the children and young people living in it.It covers all the life domains identified under the Looking After Children framework and those articulated by the Australian Government in the Outline of National Standards for Out-of-Home Care.These include: Stability and security; participation; Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander issues; planning; health needs; education; social/ recreational opportunities; connection with family; identity development; relationships with significant others; and preparation for transitioning to independence.A 146-item survey, available online as a self-administered questionnaire (for older respondents) or through structured interviews conducted face-to-face or via telephone by CREATE staff, was constructed as an elaboration of CREATE’s BeHeard tool. This interview system was developed in consultation with children and young people and has been in use since 2005 in Queensland, as well as having been employed in Tasmania and Victoria.The primary aim of the project was to give as many children and young people in care as possible the opportunity to participate in the survey. This required the cooperation of state and territory governments within Australia to provide population data from which appropriate random samples of potential participants could be drawn to maximise the representativeness of the findings. All governments with the exception of Western Australia supported the project.Based on the de-identified population data supplied by governments, random samples stratified on age, culture, and placement type were prepared for each jurisdiction. The selected children and young people and their carers were informed by mail of the rationale for, and nature of, the project and invited to participate (an “opt-in” approach). Unfortunately, the initial response was poor, so some governments allowed CREATE staff to phone potential respondents from their departmental offices. However, to increase the numbers to a reasonable sample size, respondents also were drawn from the database maintained by CREATE of children and young people in care whose contact details were known. Ultimately, 1069 participants, aged from eight to 17 years, undertook the survey. Adequate representation was obtained from New South Wales (NSW), Queensland (QLD), South Australia (SA), Tasmania (TAS), and Victoria (VIC). Northern Territory’s (NT) numbers were lower and split between Foster Care and Residential placements; the response from the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) was disappointing"
775,Principles for school drug education,"This document is intended as a set of guidelines reflected in 12 Principles for school drug education.&nbsp;These 12 principles provide a broad conceptual tool to inform the planning,&nbsp;implementation and review of school drug education programs, policies and practices.

It is noted that effective practice is dependent upon the local context and needs and the principles have been developed so they can be interpreted at this level.

The 12 Principles are interrelated,&nbsp;broad and generic,&nbsp;focused on school-based interactions and interventions, embedded within a broader health promoting approach and&nbsp;nformed by (and support) evidence-based practice.

The 12 Principles are organised around four key interconnecting themes for effective school

drug education including:

– Comprehensive and evidence-based practice,

– Positive school climate and relationships,

– Targeted to needs and context, and

– Effective pedagogy.

776,The critical decade: extreme weather,"When extreme weather events occur the Climate Commission is  consistently asked questions about the link to climate change. This  report unpacks our current knowledge about different types of extreme  weather events: extreme temperatures, rainfall, drought, bushfires,  storm surges, cyclones and storms. &nbsp; Download key facts from the report. Download summary table of the report. Download quick facts for each state: New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia, Tasmania, Australian Captial Territiory, Northern Territiory. &nbsp; 1. Climate change is already increasing the intensity and  frequency of many extreme weather events, adversely affecting  Australians. Extreme events occur naturally and weather records are  broken from time to time. However, climate change is influencing these  events and record-breaking weather is becoming more common around the  world. Some Australian examples include:  Heat: Extreme heat is increasing across Australia. There will still  be record cold events, but hot records are now happening three times  more often than cold records. Bushfire weather: Extreme fire weather has increased in many parts  of Australia, including southern NSW, Victoria, Tasmania and parts of  South Australia, over the last 30 years. Rainfall: Heavy rainfall has increased globally. Over the last three  years Australia’s east coast has experienced several very heavy  rainfall events, fuelled by record-high surface water temperatures in  the adjacent seas. Drought: A long-term drying trend is affecting the southwest corner  of Western Australia, which has experienced a 15% drop in rainfall since  the mid-1970s. Sea-level rise: Sea level has already risen 20 cm. This means that  storm surges ride on sea levels that are higher than they were a century  ago, increasing the risk of flooding along Australia’s socially,  economically and environmentally important coastlines.  2. Climate change is making many extreme events worse in  terms of their impacts on people, property, communities and the  environment. This highlights the need to take rapid, effective action on  climate change.&nbsp;  It is crucial that communities, emergency services, health and  medical services and other authorities prepare for the increases that  are already occurring in the severity and frequency of many types of  extreme weather. The southeast of Australia, including many of our largest population  centres, stands out as being at increased risk from many extreme  weather events – heatwaves, bushfires, heavy rainfall and sea-level  rise. Key food-growing regions across the southeast and the southwest are likely to experience more drought in the future. Some of Australia’s iconic ecosystems are threatened by climate  change. Over the past three decades the Great Barrier Reef has suffered  repeated bleaching events from underwater heatwaves. The freshwater  wetlands of Kakadu National Park are at risk from saltwater intrusion  due to rising sea level.  3. The climate system has shifted, and is continuing to  shift, changing the conditions for all weather, including extreme  weather events.&nbsp;  Levels of greenhouse gases from the combustion of fossil fuels have  increased by around 40% since the beginning of the Industrial  Revolution, causing the Earth’s surface to warm significantly. All weather events are now occurring in global climate system that  is warmer and moister than it was 50 years ago. This has loaded the dice  towards more frequent and more severe extreme weather events.  4. There is a high risk that extreme weather events like  heatwaves, heavy rainfall, bushfires and cyclones will become even more  intense in Australia over the coming decades.&nbsp;  There is little doubt that over the next few decades changes in  these extreme events will increase the risks of adverse consequences to  human health, agriculture, infrastructure and the environment. Stabilising the climate is like turning around a battleship – it  cannot be done immediately given its momentum. When danger is ahead you  must start turning the wheel now. Any delay means that it is more and  more difficult to avert the future danger. The climate system has strong momentum for further warming over the  next few decades because of the greenhouse gases that have already been  emitted, and those that will be emitted in future. This means that it is  highly likely that extreme weather events will become even more severe  in Australia over that period.  5. Only strong preventive action now and in the coming years  can stabilise the climate and halt the trend of increasing extreme  weather for our children and grandchildren.&nbsp;  Averting danger requires strong preventative action. How quickly and  deeply we reduce greenhouse gas emissions will greatly influence the  severity of extreme events in the future. The world is already moving to tackle climate change.&nbsp; Ninety  countries, representing 90% of global emissions, are committed to  reducing their emissions and have programs in place to achieve this. As  the 15th largest emitter in the world, Australia has an important role  to play. Much more substantial action will be required if we are to stabilise  the climate by the second half of the century. Globally emissions must  be cut rapidly and deeply to nearly zero by 2050, with Australia playing  its part. The decisions we make this decade will largely determine the  severity of climate change and its influence on extreme events that our  grandchildren will experience. This is the critical decade to get on  with the job"
777,"Literature review of the interplay between education, employment, health and wellbeing for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in remote areas","The availability of timely, comprehensive and good quality data specifically relevant to remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander notions of health and wellbeing has been a significant obstacle to understanding and addressing related disadvantage in a meaningful way. This literature review for the CRC-REP Interplay Between Health, Wellbeing, Education and Employment project explored existing wellbeing frameworks at global and local levels that are relevant to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in remote Australia.Current government frameworks that collect data about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people often produce a narrative that describes deficit, disadvantage and dysfunction. The frameworks include the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Performance Framework, the Overcoming Indigenous Disadvantage Framework, the Australia Bureau of Statistics Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Wellbeing Framework and the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Survey. These frameworks gather statistical information for the purposes of policy analysis and program development and therefore use indicators that are important to policy. Increasingly, government frameworks are including holistic measures of health such as cultural health, governance and the impacts of colonisation.This literature review has identified the need to develop a wellbeing framework that not only accurately represents education, employment, health and wellbeing and the interplay between these and other factors, but that also recognises the strengths and resilience of Aboriginal and Torres Strait people as well as reflecting their worldviews, perspectives and values. For example, a definition of ‘wellbeing’ that highlights the importance of physical, social, emotional, cultural and spiritual influences at the level of the individual and the community has been endorsed by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander groups and governments alike and sustained for over 20 years. Accordingly, this literature review has been organised along these topics.In addition, the literature suggests that optimal wellbeing occurs when there is strong cultural identity in combination with control, achievement and inclusion at a wider societal level, such as through successful engagement in education and employment. Listening to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to learn of their conceptual thinking, knowledge and understanding, and responding to their priorities and ideas are crucial parts of the policy equation to improve outcomes across education, employment, health and wellbeing. The challenges in developing an appropriate wellbeing framework, then, are ensuring the active involvement and participation of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.One example of how this has worked is provided by the Community Indicators Victoria Project, which used local-level data to address issues that the local community identified as important. A focus on strengths is also important, and is exemplified in the Social and Emotional Wellbeing Framework of the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Council and National Mental Health Working Group. Various existing programs – such as ‘Caring for Country’ – can be adapted to capture data about connection to country, for example, and how that impacts on physical and mental health. Critically, the core domains of education, employment and health need to be extended to include activities and concepts that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people consider important to these areas.Recommendations for the development of a wellbeing framework are proposed here, derived from information available in the literature. Rather than being definitive, these recommendations provide a starting point for consultation and adaption towards establishing a wellbeing framework and operational system for collecting and analysing long-term health and wellbeing data for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in remote Australia as part of the research conducted by CRC-REP"
778,The power of wireless cloud,"Previous analysis and industry focus has missed the point: access networks, not data centres, are the biggest threat to the sustainability of cloud services. This is because more people are accessing cloud services via wireless networks. These networks are inherently energy inefficient and a disproportionate contributor to cloud energy consumption.Cloud computing has rapidly emerged as the driving trend in global Internet services. It is being promoted as a green technology that can significantly reduce energy consumption by centralising the computing power of organisations that manage large IT systems and devices. The substantial energy savings available to organisations moving their ICT services into the cloud has been the subject of several recent white papers.Another trend that continues unabated is the take-up and use of personal wireless communications devices. These include mobile phones, wireless-enabled laptops, smartphones and tablets. In fact, tablets don’t accommodate a traditional cable connection; rather it is assumed a local or mobile wireless connection will be used to support all data transferred to and from the device. There is a significant emerging convergence between cloud computing and wireless communication, providing consumers with access to a vast array of cloud applications and services with the convenience of anywhere, anytime, any network functionality from the device of their choice. These are services many of us use every day like Google Apps, Office 365, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Facebook, Zoho cloud office suite, and many more.To date, discussion about the energy efficiency of cloud services has focussed on data centres, the facilities used to store and serve the massive amounts of data underpinning these services. The substantial energy consumption of data centres is undeniable and has been the subject of recent high-profile reports including the Greenpeace report, HowClean is Your Cloud.However, focussing cloud efficiency debate on data centres alone obscures a more significant and complex problem and avoids the critical issue of inefficiency in the wireless access network.&nbsp"
779,Occupational health and safety of migrant sex workers in New Zealand,"This research provides an in-depth understanding of issues facing migrant sex workers in New Zealand, with a particular focus on occupational health and safety, and sexual reproductive health.

It was intended that the research would provide an evidence base from which NZPC could develop and provide migrant-relevant advocacy and services. Specific research objectives include:

1. understand the New Zealand sex work context in which migrants are working

2. identify the specific needs of migrant sex workers with regards to: occupational health and safety needs; sexual and reproductive needs; and any other needs that may contribute to the general health of migrant sex workers

3. identify barriers and facilitators to migrant sex workers\u27 receipt of appropriate services and/or required assistance"
780,Measuring the economic contribution of cultural industries,"This 2012 update of a 2009 study provides an overview of current methods for measuring the contribution of cultural industries in today’s economy.Cultural industries are becoming important components of today’s economy, propelling innovation and development. Evidence suggests that cultural industries, which can encompass everything from the performing arts and museums to film production and video games, contribute to gross domestic product and employment, and can improve a country’s foreign trade position and competitiveness.In Germany, enterprise from cultural and creative industries represented 7.4% of the value added to the economy in 2009. In Mali the cultural sector contributed 2.38% to the GDP in 2006. However, there are few cross-nationally comparable statistics and methodologies to quantify the effect of these industries at the global level.The UIS is seeking to develop new as well as complementary guidelines to measure the contribution of culture to economies, especially in the developing world where data and resources are limited.To this end, the study provides an exhaustive literature review of current methodologies. It compares several approaches, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. The report offers an important resource for governments interested in measuring the economic contribution of cultural industries in their countries.The material presented in the study will serve to support the development of a methodological handbook on measuring the contribution of the culture sector"
781,Strategies to minimise the incidence of suicide and suicidal behaviour,"This resource sheet provides a review of policies and programs that aim to prevent suicide and suicidal behaviour. Suicidal behaviour refers to actions that can result in death, such as taking an overdose or deliberately crashing a car. The scope of this resource sheet does not include self-injury that is part of the cultural grieving process (‘sorry business’).

While it is known that high levels of mental health and wellbeing decrease the risk of suicide, programs to promote mental health and wellbeing are also not considered in this resource sheet, as they are the subject of a separate resource sheet Strategies and practices for promoting the social and emotional wellbeing of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Effective mental health promotion programs include cultural healing programs, culturally appropriate mental health services and the Indigenous Hip Hop program. Also important are Indigenous adaptations of effective mainstream programs such as the Resourceful Adolescent Program, MindMatters (a mental health promotion program for secondary schools) and the Triple P-Positive Parenting Program.

Suicide is strongly associated with the use of alcohol and other drugs. Strategies to reduce alcohol and other drug-related harm are also not included as they are the subject of a separate resource sheet Reducing alcohol and other drug related harm.

This resource sheet considers suicide prevention policies and programs that have been implemented in both remote and non-remote parts of Australia and internationally. It assesses their strengths and limitations and their actual, or likely, effectiveness in relation to Indigenous Australians"
782,The impact of Indigenous community sports programs: the case of surfing,"The objective of this research project was to consider the social impact of sport and physical activity on the lives of Indigenous Australians and their communities. There has been strong research interest in the links between sport and recreation programs and various health and social outcomes and a well-established body of literature exists on the use of sport to address social issues in mainstream society. The consensus is that physical activity is an important contributor to health for all people. While there is strong research interest, what remains unclear is the value and impact of sport and physical activity on Indigenous communities.Indigenous groups cannot be considered to be homogenous as there is much diversity between and within groups. It is therefore important this report is not viewed as taking an essentialist view of who Indigenous people are and how they develop. Rather, this paper attempts to describe and discuss the experiences of some individuals and their communities in site-specific surfing programs.The results of this project indicate that surfing should continue to be considered as an appropriate sport for use with Indigenous communities.It should be noted, however, that any program needs to take into consideration the diversity of Indigenous culture, how communities operate and should seek appropriate guidance.While there was great variety in terms of how surf programs in this study operated, there were some common elements across all programs including: strict surfer-to-coach ratios, opt-in opt-out structures and avoidance of controlling coach behaviours.In addition to these characteristics, quality programs also had consistency in personnel (small groups rather than single providers).This research project provided experience and information to develop recommendations relating to future similar programs including:Programs should be supported in longer term allotments Programs should collect meaningful data (well-constructed interview and survey protocols) over and above simple participation statistics To achieve meaningful outcomes, programs need continuity and should not be one-offs As transport costs represent the greatest barrier to participation in programs and surfing as a lifestyle pursuit, programs should consider the transport options most suitable for their area. Individuals who participated in the research highlighted that it can take a long time for the effects of programs to be felt. As a result, longitudinal tracking by program providers is required to provide ongoing evidence in support of programs. Funding to programs should also be sought across longer time frames to provide a greater platform to generate positive outcomes.Through this research it was possible to identify the development of individual and organisational capacity. In both areas, however, these capacities were not automatically enhanced. Careful planning and strong encouragement and support from program providers were required"

784,Measuring mental health in criminology research: Lessons from the Drug Use Monitoring in Australia program,"Poor mental health among people in the Australian criminal justice  system is increasingly being identified and targeted for remediation.  This is evidenced by Australian and international governments  establishing specialist services for prisoners with mental disorders  such as forensic hospitals, forensic units within prisons and specialist  drug treatment programs within correctional environments (eg Birgden  &amp; Grant 2010; Justice Health &amp; Forensic Mental Health Network  2011). Drug courts, mental health courts, court liaison services and  pre-court diversion schemes for drug addicted or mentally ill offenders  are also increasingly being established to divert mentally disordered  and/or substance dependent offenders away from the criminal justice  system and towards treatment (Justice Health &amp; Forensic Mental  Health Network 2011; Payne 2006; Richardson 2008). This focus by the criminal justice system on addiction and  mental health stems from evidence indicating that these factors may be  related to offending behaviour and rehabilitation prospects (Andrews  &amp; Bonta 2010; Day &amp; Howells 2008). The link between illicit drug  use and criminal offending has been well established (Andrews &amp;  Bonta 2010; Bradford &amp; Payne 2012; Kinner et al. 2009) and evidence  also suggests a relationship between mental disorders and illicit drug  use (Degenhardt 2008; Frisher et al. 2005; Marsh 2008; Mattick &amp;  O’Brien 2008). However, the findings regarding a relationship between  mental disorders and offending behaviour are varied (Andrews &amp; Bonta  2010), with some studies suggesting that the relationship is not a  direct one but rather, may be mediated by substance abuse (Elbogen &amp;  Johnson 2009; Fazel et al. 2009). While it is arguable that mental disorders play a causal role  in offending behaviour, studies have identified that imprisoned  offenders experience poor mental health (AIHW 2012; Butler &amp; Allnutt  2003; Fazel &amp; Danesh 2002). It is also widely accepted that  offenders who are mentally ill are less able to respond to offender  rehabilitation programs (Andrews &amp; Bonta 2010), thereby making  mental health treatment important not only on humanitarian grounds but  also to give offender rehabilitation programs the best possible chance  of success. It is important to note that prisoners constitute a minority  of offenders, as most people who appear in court are not given a  custodial sentence (BOCSAR 2012), however recent studies of police  detainees suggest that alleged offenders (ie those not yet brought  before the courts) may also experience poor mental health at the time of  their arrest (Baksheev, Ogloff &amp; Thomas 2010; Forsythe &amp;  Gaffney 2012; Heffernan et al. 2003). One issue that has been  highlighted by such studies is the challenge of accurately measuring  mental health among people who are detained for short periods of time in  police cells or watchhouses.This report is focused on describing and discussing the process and  challenges inherent in measuring mental health concerns among alleged  offenders in police custody. This is, in part, informed by the author’s  experience as the Site Manager responsible for DUMA data collection in  New South Wales from 1999–2010; a role that included evaluating and  improving the mental health information collected as part of the DUMA  program"

786,A spatial vulnerability analysis of urban populations during extreme heat events in Australian capital cities,"Extreme heat events pose a risk to the health of all individuals, especially the elderly and the chronically ill, and are associated with an increased demand for healthcare services.

In order to address this problem, policy makers need information about temperatures above which mortality and morbidity of the exposed population is likely to increase, where the vulnerable groups in the community are located, and how the risks from extreme heat events are likely to change in the future.&nbsp;

This study identified threshold temperatures for all Australian capital cities, developed a spatial index of population vulnerability, and used climate model output to predict changes in the number of days exceeding temperature thresholds in the future, as well as changes in risk related to changes in urban density and an ageing population.&nbsp;

The study has shown that daily maximum and minimum temperatures from the Bureau of Meteorology forecasts can be used to calculate temperature thresholds for heat alert days. The key risk factors related to adverse health outcomes were found to be areas with intense urban heat islands, areas with higher proportions of older people, and areas with ethnic communities.&nbsp;

Maps of spatial vulnerability have been developed to provide information to assist emergency managers, healthcare professionals, and ancillary services develop heatwave preparedness plans at a local scale that target vulnerable groups and address heat-related health risks. The numbers of days exceeding current heat thresholds are predicted to increase over the next 20 to 40 years in all Australian capital cities.

787,"Service and support requirements of people with younger onset dementia and their families final report, August, 2012","In 2011, Alzheimer’s Australia NSW (AlzNSW) was engaged by Ageing, Disability and Home Care  (ADHC) to research the service and support requirements of people with younger onset dementia and  their families in New South Wales. AlzNSW partnered with the Social Policy Research Centre (SPRC)  and UnitingCare Ageing to conduct the research.
This report outlines the methods, findings and policy  implications of the research. Dementia is a major cause of disability amongst older people and some younger people aged under  65 years, causing ‘progressive change and degeneration in cognitive mental functions, such as  memory, language, rational thinking and social skills, as well as behaviour, emotion and personality’  (Mocellin, Scholes and Velakoulis, 2008:1). Younger onset dementia is defined as dementia which  occurs before the age of 65 years and under 50 years for Aboriginal people.

789,Effective interventions for working with young people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness,"This literature review was commissioned by the Commonwealth Department of Families, Housing, Community  Services and Indigenous Affairs (FaHCSIA). The aim of the review is to assess the current state of evidence  about what interventions are most effective in working with young people who are homeless or at risk of  homelessness.
This literature review was produced in order to inform a broader project that identifies the range  of interventions and strategies that are applied by Reconnect services and situates these practices within the  existing evidence base (see separate report, Reconnect: working with young people who are homeless or at risk  of homelessness).  Reconnect is a community-based early intervention program for young people who are homeless or at risk of  homelessness. It was established in 1998 as an early intervention response to youth homelessness. Reconnect  uses early intervention strategies to help young people to stabilise and improve their housing, achieve family  reconciliation, and improve their level of engagement with work, education, training and community.
FaHCSIA funds Reconnect services to deliver services to young people aged 12–18 years (newly arrived young  people 12–21 years) who are homeless or at risk of homelessness, and their families. Some Reconnect services  focus on working with specific population groups, for example: Indigenous young people (Aboriginal or Torres  Strait Islander people); young people experiencing mental health issues; and newly arrived young people. This review is guided by the key research question: ‘what are effective intervention strategies for working with  young people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness?’ The literature review begins with a brief overview of  youth homelessness as an issue of concern, its identified relevant risk and protective factors, and the relevance  of early intervention. It then outlines the strategy for undertaking this literature review and presents the findings  of the review"

The HPF was designed to measure the impact of the National Strategic Framework for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health (NSFATSIH) and will be an important tool for developing the new National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Plan. The HPF monitors progress in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health outcomes, health system performance and the broader determinants of health.

The health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples is improving for a number of measures, although there remain many areas where further concerted effort will be needed to achieve improvements in health outcomes.

791,Views of young people in residential care survey: Responding to trauma and attachment needs in residential care,"This paper aims to contribute to the task of evaluating Queensland’s efforts to cultivate trauma and attachment informed residential care environments. This is achieved, firstly, by identifying broad therapeutic goals and core therapeutic tasks of trauma and attachment informed residential care based on an examination of the theoretical and research literature. The paper then considers evidence from a valuable contemporary source of information about the quality of therapeutic practice in Queensland residential care – the 2011 Views of Young People in Residential Care Survey.

This survey investigates young people’s observations and perceptions of the care environment and aspects of their personal wellbeing relevant to two core therapeutic tasks – building therapeutic caring relationships with young people and creating sanctuary in the care environment"
792,The least developed countries report 2012,"The uncertain global economic recovery and the worsening Eurozone crisis continue to undermine those factors  that enabled the least developed countries (LDCs) as a group to attain higher growth rates between 2002 and 2008.  Despite seeing real gross domestic product (GDP) grow slightly faster in 2010, the group as a whole performed less  favourably in 2011, signalling challenges ahead. Indeed, with the world’s attention focused on Europe, there is a  danger that the international community may lose sight of the fact that in recent years, LDCs have been most affected  by inancial crises caused by other countries. 
With less diversiied economies, LDCs have neither the reserves nor  the resources needed to cushion their economies and adjust easily to negative shocks. Furthermore, if another global  downturn hurts the growth prospects of emerging economies, LDCs, as major commodity exporters, will be directly  affected. Therefore, LDCs require increased external assistance to better protect their economies against external  shocks and help them manage volatilit"
793,Evaluating drug law enforcement interventions directed towards methamphetamine in Australia,"This report presents a preliminary analysis comparing the costs and impacts different types of law enforcement have on methamphetamine use.
Methamphetamine belongs in the class of stimulant drugs referred to as Amphetamine Type Stimulants (ATS). The category of ATS includes ecstasy, amphetamine and methamphetamine. This research project concerned itself with the amphetamine and methamphetamine class and excluded ecstasy (and henceforth we use the generic term methamphetamine). In Australia, methamphetamine is available in three forms—powder, base and crystal. Methamphetamine is associated with significant harms and is an important drug policy priority. The National Amphetamine-Type Stimulants Strategy (2008–2011) articulates the following priority areas in relation to methamphetamine:

improve community awareness and understanding of amphetamine-type stimulant use and related problems; 
reduce the supply of amphetamine-type stimulants; 
develop specific strategies to prevent and reduce amphetamine type stimulant use; and 
develop organisational and system capacity to prevent and respond to amphetamine-type stimulant problems 

This research concerns the second priority area—reducing the supply of methamphetamine. The specific aims of the research were twofold:

to provide a rich description of the Australian methamphetamine supply chains in order to inform drug law enforcement interventions; and 
to conduct an initial economic evaluation comparing law enforcement interventions directed at the methamphetamine market. 

The work focused on the methamphetamine market(s) and supply chains in Australia above the retail level. Previous research has examined retail methamphetamine markets in Australia.
Governments and policymakers are interested in determining which interventions are more or less effective than others, such that the scarce funding resources can be allocated in the most efficient manner possible. There is scant research available to law enforcement to guide such decisions. The main impediments to such research are the fundamental methodological challenges inherent in such an undertaking. This project is an attempt to conduct a preliminary analysis comparing the costs and impacts of different types of law enforcement. It is a ground-breaking study as this has not been previously attempted and it should be seen as the initial development of a methodological approach that can be improved upon with subsequent research. The project aimed to determine the relative cost-to-impact ratios of different law enforcement strategies aimed at reducing methamphetamine production and distribution. In an environment focused on efficiency in resource allocation, it is hoped that this research will provide the impetus for further research on the effectiveness of drug law enforcement. As the results of such research accumulate, it is hoped that policymakers will be able to use the information to improve decision making on law enforcement investment"
794,Turn down the heat,"This report provides a snapshot of recent scientific literature and new analyses of likely impacts and risks that would be associated with a 4° Celsius warming within this century.&nbsp; It is a rigorous attempt to outline a range of risks, focusing on developing countries and especially the poor. A 4°C world would be one of unprecedented heat waves, severe drought, and major floods in many regions, with serious impacts on ecosystems and associated services.&nbsp;But with action, a 4°C world can be avoided and we can likely hold warming below 2°C.
Without further commitments and action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the world is likely to warm by more than 3°C above the preindustrial climate. Even with the current mitigation commitments and pledges fully implemented, there is roughly a 20 percent likelihood of exceeding 4°C by 2100.
If they are not met, a warming of 4°C could occur as early as the 2060s. Such a warming level and associated sea-level rise of 0.5 to 1 meter, or more, by 2100 would not be the end point: a further warming to levels over 6°C, with several meters of sea-level rise, would likely occur over the following centuries"
795,Survey analysis for Indigenous policy in Australia,"Indigenous policy is a complex domain  motivated by a range of social, cultural, political and economic issues.  The Council of Australian Governments ‘closing the gaps’ agenda for  addressing Indigenous disadvantage in Australia now includes six targets  with well defined and measurable outcomes for policy action. In this  context there is a continuing and pressing need for robust debate to  understand how meaningful improvement in Indigenous outcomes might be  achieved.
This monograph presents the  peer-reviewed proceedings of the 2011 CAEPR/ABS conference on ‘Social  Science Perspectives on the 2008 National and Aboriginal Torres Strait  Islander Social Survey’. It is the fourth CAEPR monograph since 1992 to  reflect on national surveys of Indigenous Australians. The conference  covered topics including child development, crime and justice, culture,  wellbeing, the customary economy, demography, education, employment,  fertility, health, housing, income and financial stress, mobility,  poverty, social exclusion, and substance abuse. The papers summarise the  strengths and limitations of the 2008 NATSISS, discuss the types of  policy-relevant questions it can inform, and consider future survey  design.
A social survey such as the NATSISS can  ultimately never tell those responsible for developing public policy  what to do, but it can provide useful information to inform policy  decisions. This volume will be useful for researchers and policy makers,  and relevant to the wider national debate and, in particular,  Indigenous communities and organisations"
796,Situating women: gender politics and circumstance in Fiji,"Since the time of decolonisation in Fiji, women’s organisations have  navigated a complex political terrain. While they have stayed true to  the aim of advancing women’s status, their work has been buffeted by  national political upheavals and changing global and regional directions  in development policy-making.
This book documents how women activists  have understood and responded to these challenges.&nbsp; It is the first book  to write women into Fiji’s postcolonial history, providing a detailed  historical account of that country’s gender politics across four  tumultuous decades.&nbsp; It is also the first to examine the ‘situated’  nature of gender advocacy in the Pacific Islands more broadly. It does  this by analysing trends in activity, from women’s radical and  provocative activism of the 1960s to a more self-evaluative and  reflexive mood of engagement in later decades, showing how interplaying  global and local factors can shape women’s understandings of gender  justice and their pursuit of that goal"
797,Flying academics – examining short-term international teaching assignments impact on academics’ career success and work-life balance,"This thesis explores the views and experiences of academics involved in  short-term international teaching assignments and the specific  strategies employed by universities to manage and support their career  success and work-life balance.
Accordingly, this thesis examines the  challenges faced, and the type and quality of support that might be  deemed as appropriate for academics. The present thesis involves two  interrelated studies (Study 1 &amp; Study 2), utilizing a sequential  exploratory design characterized by a qualitative investigation prior to  quantitative data collection and analysis.
Study 1 demonstrates the  inter relationships between perceived organisational support, career  success, and work-life balance; explicating why these relationships are  important for academics engaged in short-term international teaching  assignments.
Study 2 extends the proposed model formulated in Study 1,  aiming to prioritize support factors involved in short-term  international teaching assignments.
Specifically, findings suggest that  academics who perceive their organisation as career-supportive  experience enhanced levels of career satisfaction and career  development. Findings also suggest that employees’ career success appear  to be related strongly to work-life balance. These findings point to  the all-round benefits that can result when universities reward their  academics and capitalize on their offshore teaching experience. Such  affirmative action would appear to acknowledge offshore teaching  experience as being both important and integral to academics’ career  development"
798,Legal Australia-wide survey: legal need in Victoria,"This survey provides the first comprehensive quantitative assessment across Australia of an extensive range of legal needs on a representative sample of the population.
It examines the nature of legal problems, the pathways to their resolution, and the demographic groups that struggle with the weight of their legal problems.
The present report is one in a series of nine reports that provides the initial findings of a national survey of legal needs — the LAW Survey. The series consists of a report on Australia as a whole and a report on each state/territory.
The LAW Survey deals with key questions that go to the heart of understanding the legal and access to justice needs of the community, and how to address these needs. It assesses the prevalence of legal problems across the community, and the vulnerability of different demographic groups to different types of legal problems. It examines the various adverse consequences that can accompany legal problems, as well as the responses people take when faced with legal problems and the outcomes they achieve.
Significantly, incorporating 20 716 interviews across Australia, the LAW Survey is the largest legal needs survey to date conducted anywhere in the world. It provides an unrivalled dataset for the ongoing investigation of the types of legal problems that are often captured by smaller surveys in insufficient numbers for meaningful analysis, such as rare legal problems and the legal problems experienced by minority demographic groups.
The report series brings together the results of the detailed analysis of the data from the LAW Survey with the most up-to-date review of the leading legal needs research internationally and in Australia. Not surprisingly, there are many consistencies — and some differences — across time and across jurisdictions"
799,The role of alcohol in crime and disorder,"Looking into the Australian culture of drinking and the correlations it has with crime numbers.
Four out of five Australians aged over 14 years report being recent drinkers and one in five report drinking seven or more drinks on a single occasion at least monthly.&nbsp;1 Two-thirds (61 per cent) of 18–29-year-olds report consuming alcohol for the purpose of getting drunk.2 The annual cost of alcohol-related harm in Australia is estimated between $15.63 and $36 billion,4 depending on the model used and whether harm to others is included in the model.
The personal cost of alcohol-related trauma to many individuals is overwhelming.4 Virtually every type of alcohol-related harm is on the rise in Australia.5 This report provides a review of the literature and statistics related to alcohol consumption and crime and disorder in Australia and Victoria. This paper is part of a ‘suite’ of resources for government (local, state and federal), the justice sector, health professionals and associated agencies. It offers an overview of proven and promising strategies for reducing alcohol-influenced crime and disorder"
800,Addressing uncomfortable issues: the role of White health professionals in Aboriginal health,"This research investigated the role of  White health professionals in addressing Aboriginal health in South  Australia.&nbsp;Set within the discipline of nutrition and dietetics and the area of obesity prevention, it explored the practice of White health professionals from the point of view of Aboriginal and White workers.
This research, currently in the form of an unpublished Doctor of Philosophy thesis, arose from practice dilemmas the author experienced as a dietitian  working in rural and remote South Australia.
The setting for this  research was the eat well be active Community Programs, a  community-based, childhood obesity prevention program in South  Australia. In order to conduct ethical research, the author worked closely with  Aboriginal community members and workers, through building and  maintaining relationships and activities of reciprocity.
This research is  positioned in a social constructionist epistemology and uses a critical  theoretical approach. Critical social research and reflexivity are the  methodological approaches. The kept a reflexive journal and conducted 41  semi-structured interviews with White health professionals and  Aboriginal health workers and one focus group with White health  professionals; all of which formed the data for this research.
This research identified that there are a number of elements to the  practice of White health professionals that make it ideal when they are  working with Aboriginal communities. However, such ideal practice does  not always occur and this research sought to identify why. The  organisation, profession and individual were identified as systems  within the wider system of Aboriginal health.
Within these systems, the author identified structures (rules and resources) that either constrain or  enable the practice of White health professionals with Aboriginal  people. While many White health professionals focussed on external  factors that constrained their practice, this thesis identifies the role of  individuals in creating and maintaining barriers and enablers, thus  highlighting their agency. It was also identified that White health  professionals progress through a number of stages in their work in  Aboriginal health, from not knowing how, to being scared, to finding it  too hard and ultimately being able to practice regardless of barriers.
In summary, this research identified that moving forward in Aboriginal  health requires White health professionals to look at themselves, which  generally requires them to address uncomfortable issues"
801,Sustained home visiting for vulnerable families and children: a literature review of effective programs,"Parenting young children has become a more complex and stressful business, especially for those families in our community with the least resources (Grose, 2006; Hayes et al, 2010; Poole, 2004; Richardson &amp; Prior, 2005; Trask, 2010). A widening gap exists between families that function well and those that are vulnerable. The paradox of service delivery for children and families is that vulnerable families – that is, those families with the greatest needs – are also the least likely to be able to access those services (Ghate &amp; Hazel, 2002; Fram, 2003). A range of barriers exist for vulnerable and at risk families in making use of services (Carbone et al, 2004).

One of the key barriers to vulnerable families accessing services is that many find it difficult to relate to the formal service system and are easily alienated by practices others find acceptable. Research regarding parents’ experiences of support services suggests that parents want services where they are simultaneously cared for and enabled in their role as parents, and to receive services characterised by empathy, competence, functionality, respect, flexibility and honesty (Attide-Stirling et al, 2001; Winkworth et al, 2009). Vulnerable parents fear a loss of autonomy in their interactions with support services and want services that are non-judgemental and that provide continuity of care (Ghate &amp; Hazel, 2002; von Bultzingslowen, 2006).

In addition to the barriers faced by vulnerable and marginalised families in accessing services, the system does not work in an integrated or coherent fashion to ensure that all children and families needing support receive it. Furthermore, the vast majority of services for children and families in Australia do not have an outreach function, that is, a means of engaging these vulnerable and at risk families who are in need of support but use services inconsistently or not at all. In short, the service system was not designed to meet the needs of vulnerable families within the context of a rapidly changing social and economic climate. Therefore, many families requiring support are not receiving it.

802,"Targeting brain, body and heart for cognitive health and dementia prevention","This report looks into the current research regarding dementia and&nbsp;Alzheimer\u27s disease prevention and offers ideas for possible future solutions.&nbsp;Prevention of dementia is the ultimate aim of a large, albeit under resourced, international research effort. The success of this effort would have enormous benefits for millions of people and save billions of dollars in health care costs. Conversely, the status quo will see the number of Australians living with dementia soar in coming years. Many more people will experience and seek help for mild cognitive impairment. There are many different forms of dementia, a syndrome caused by brain disease and characterised by declining cognitive function that impairs daily activities.
Dementia can affect memory, language, attention, judgement, planning, behaviour, mood and personality. Mild cognitive impairment does not significantly impair daily activities, but often represents an earlier stage of cognitive decline. There is no cure for the common forms of cognitive decline and dementia, including the most common, Alzheimer’s disease. A cure may only be achieved by prevention, because the diseases that cause dementia begin many years before symptoms become apparent and gradually damage the brain until it can no longer function normally. Intervening early to stop or slow disease progression, before cognitive impairment emerges, offers the best hope of preventing dementia.
Is this achievable? It requires breakthroughs in early detection and intervention. New diagnostic technologies have been developed that can detect the presence of abnormal protein accumulations in the brain that characterise Alzheimer’s disease. The disease can now be detected by brain scans or cerebrospinal fluid tests in the preclinical stage, before any cognitive changes occur"
803,Weathering uncertainty traditional knowledge for climate change assessment and adaptation,"This UNESCO report looks into the damaging effects of climate change on Indigenous cultures.When considering climate change, indigenous peoples and marginalized populations warrant particular attention. Impacts on their territories and communities are anticipated to be both early and severe due to their location in vulnerable environments, including small islands, high-altitude zones, desert margins and the circumpolar Arctic.
Indeed, climate change poses a direct threat to many indigenous societies due to their continuing reliance upon resource-based livelihoods. Heightened exposure to negative impacts, however, is not the only reason for specific attention and concern.
As many indigenous societies are socially and culturally distinct from mainstream society, decisions, policies and actions undertaken by the majority, even if well-intended, may prove inadequate, ill-adapted, and even inappropriate. There is therefore a need to understand the specific vulnerabilities, concerns, adaptation capacities and longer-term aspirations of indigenous peoples and marginalized communities throughout the world. Indigenous and traditional knowledge contribute to this broader understanding"

It examines the following areas:

The  place of authentic learning in postgraduate education.
The  methods used to simulate policy development, and related  activities like  strategy planning, in educational environments relevant  to national security  policy-making.
Policy  simulation methods that could enhance learning at the  College and similar  institutions, including teaching skills, technology  and resource implications.

805,The link between fiscal deficit and inflation: do public sector wages matter?,"This paper investigates the validity of the hypothesis that suggests there is a link between fiscal deficits and inflation in developing countries and further explores this link in the absence of public sector wage expenditure. Sri Lanka, a developing country with a persistent fiscal deficit, a large public sector and increasing inflation, has been chosen for the empirical study. An auto-regressive distributed lag (ARDL) model is employed in the analysis, using annual data from 1959 to 2008.
The results suggest that, in the long run, a one percentage point increase in the ratio of the fiscal deficit to narrow money is associated with about an 11 percentage point increase in inflation. This link becomes weaker in the absence of the public sector wage expenditure. The overall inference is that inflation is not only a monetary phenomenon in Sri Lanka and public sector wage expenditure is a key factor in explaining the deficit-inflation relationship"
806,"Public risk perceptions, understandings and responses to climate change in Australia and Great Britain","This final report presents and discusses national survey findings from a collaborative and cross-national research project undertaken by Griffith University (Australia) and Cardiff University (UK) examining public risk perceptions, understandings and responses to the threat and unfolding impacts of climate change in Australia and Great Britain. The Australian national survey was undertaken between 6 June and 6 July, 2010 and involved a representative and geographically and demographically stratified national sample of 3096 respondents. The British survey was undertaken between 6 January and 26 March, 2010 and involved a representative quota sample of 1822 respondents residing in England, Scotland and Wales. These articulated surveys were distinctive in their cross-national comparative collaboration, in their psychological and social science nature, focus, and design, in their indepth nature, and in their focus on underlying public understandings and psychological responses to climate change"
807,"Families, life events and family service delivery","Life events or transitions are understood to be circumstances that have an unsettling element for individuals (and from a systemic perspective, for family members also). Life events or transitions, even when pursued and ultimately beneficial, usually require adjustment on one or more fronts and relinquishment of at least some areas of familiarity. Examples of life events include: births, establishing a new relationship, moving house, entering the education system, starting a new job, experiencing a physical or mental illness, deaths, and so on. The Australian Institute of Family Studies (the Institute; AIFS) has completed this literature review on life events at the request of the Portfolio Department of Human Services (the Department; DHS)"

809,Families with multiple and complex needs,"People with complex needs may have to negotiate several issues in their life, such as physical  or mental illness, substance abuse and disability. They may be living in deprived circumstances  and lack access to suitable housing, employment or meaningful daily activities.
Each individual with multiple and complex needs has unique concerns tied closely to the  interaction between his/her social, economic and health care needs, and so requires an  individualised response.  Within child protection and family intervention work, the phrase ‘multiple and complex needs’  can be used to refer to families presenting with circumstances and behaviours that are having  negative consequences for family members, particularly children"
810,The influence of motivation in recruitment and retention of rural and remote allied health professionals: a literature review,"This study took a new approach by reviewing the literature describing the motivation of AHPs to work in remote and rural areas and then analyzing the findings from the perspective of motivation theory using Herzberg’s extrinsic and intrinsic classification.
Recruitment and retention of allied health professionals (AHPs) to remote and rural Australia is challenging and  correlates with poorer health status of remote and rural residents. While much has been written about the recruitment and retention  problem, this study took a new approach by reviewing the literature describing the motivation of AHPs to work in remote and rural  areas and then analyzing the findings from the perspective of motivation theory using Herzberg’s extrinsic and intrinsic classification.  Intrinsic motivation incentives are known to contribute to job satisfaction and come from within the individual, for example the  pleasure derived from autonomy or challenge at work. In contrast, extrinsic motivation incentives are  provided by the job and  include such factors as salary and professional development provisions. Extrinsic incentives are important because they prevent job  dissatisfaction. Job satisfaction has been shown to be linked with increased retention"
811,Making a difference: building on young people’s experiences of economic adversity,"The Making a Difference Project was designed to explore the perceptions of children and young people (aged between 11 and 17 years) who experience economic adversity in order to understand what it means to them, how they experience exclusion in the family, at school, and in the communities where they live, and identify what services they think can make a difference.

The project adopted a rights perspective which emphasises the importance not only of listening to children, but of using their perspectives in making decisions on matters affecting them.

812,Classification - content regulation and convergent media,"This Inquiry provided the opportunity to reform Australia’s classification laws to meet the challenges of a convergent media environment.

Piecemeal regulatory responses to changes in technologies, markets and consumer behaviour have created uncertainty for both consumers and industry, and raise questions about where responsibilities lie for driving change. Current legislation is characterised by what the ACMA has described as ‘broken concepts’: laws built upon platform-based media regulation, that become less and less effective in a convergent media environment"
813,Compulsory licensing of patents,"The Commission has been asked to report on the compulsory licensing provisions of the Patents Act 1990 (Commonwealth Patents Act). Compulsory licensing is a safeguard that may be invoked when the exclusive rights conferred by a patent are not meeting the reasonable requirements of the public or constitute anti-competitive conduct.

&nbsp;

This inquiry was preceded by several reviews of Australia’s patents system, including those that focused on the patenting of genes. In November 2011, the Australian Government (2011) foreshadowed an inquiry on compulsory licensing in response to reports from the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC 2004) and Senate Community Affairs References Committee (SCARC 2010).

These bodies called for legislative changes to clarify the conditions under which a compulsory licence would be granted, noting that the provisions had rarely been used.

The full terms of reference for the inquiry are provided in Attachment A. In summary, the Commission has been asked to:


	assess whether the current compulsory licensing provisions can be invoked efficiently and effectively&nbsp;
	advise on the frequency, and impact, of compulsory licences in comparable markets and the common features of such licences&nbsp;
	recommend any measures that may be required to efficiently and effectively exercise Australia’s compulsory licensing provisions&nbsp;
	recommend any alternative mechanisms deemed necessary to ensure that the balance between incentives to innovate and to access technology best reflects the objectives of reasonable access to health care, maximising economic growth and growing the Australian manufacturing industry&nbsp;
	recommend measures to raise awareness of the compulsory licensing provisions.

814,First-response police officers working in single person patrols: a literature review,"This literature review examines single person police patrols both in Australia and internationally. 

The report examines challenges faced by first-response police officers when working alone and the impact this had on them, operational decisions to deploy single person patrols and how the community view this issue. It concludes that there has been limited research on single person patrols in policing and of the research findings available in the literature, results are mixed and updated research needs to be undertaken.

Instead of focusing solely on the relative advantages and disadvantages of single and two person patrols, four specific research questions were investigated:


	What are the challenges faced by first-response police officers when performing their duties solo? Specifically, has the policing environment changed since solo policing was introduced?
	What impact does working alone have on officers being able to successfully perform their duties?
	How are decisions made to deploy single person patrols?
	Are single person patrol strategies in line with community expectations"
815,Family violence and Commonwealth laws— improving legal frameworks,"This Report contains 102 recommendations for reform of Commonwealth laws that  affect people experiencing family violence. The Report builds upon the work  undertaken by the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) and the New South  Wales Law Reform Commission leading to the report, Family Violence—A National  Legal Response, ALRC Report 114 (2010).
Both inquiries emanate from the work of  the National Council to Reduce Violence  Against Women and their Children (the National Council), established in May 2008.  The report,  Time for Action: The National Council’s Plan for Australia to Reduce  Violence against Women and their Children, 2009–2021  (Time for Action), was  released on 29 April 2009"
816,"Accessing maternal and child health services in Melbourne, Australia: reflections from refugee families and service providers","This study aims to explore experiences of using&nbsp;maternal and child health&nbsp;services, from the perspective of families from refugee backgrounds and service providers. Often new arrivals from refugee backgrounds have experienced poor health and limited access to healthcare services. 

The maternal and child health (MCH) service in Victoria, Australia, is a joint local and state government operated, cost-free service available to all mothers of children aged 0–6 years. Although well-child healthcare visits are useful in identifying health issues early, there has been limited investigation in the use of these services for families from refugee backgrounds"
817,Australia’s export credit arrangements,"This report reviews the government’s role in the provision of export credits, and its support for Australian exports and overseas investments through financial products and   services.

Key points• The Export Finance and Insurance Corporation (EFIC) has been established to facilitate and encourage Australian export trade through the provision of financial services. EFIC is expected to conduct its origination business (loans, guarantees, insurance) on a commercial basis. EFIC also manages the national interest account.
• Virtually all of Australia’s exports, by volume and value, take place without EFIC’s assistance. EFIC’s support goes to relatively few firms and often on a repeat basis. By value most of the support is targeted to large corporate clients. These clients account for more than three quarters of the value of EFIC’s signings in 2010-11.
• Over the past five years, EFIC has earned most of its income through the investment of surplus funds and its capital and reserves, not the provision of financial services. EFIC’s commercial account operations have yielded a low rate of return, with some facilities subsidised by taxpayers.
• EFIC’s commercial account objective should be to efficiently address the limited number of market failures that impede otherwise commercially viable export transactions.
• While few, if any, markets conform to the competitive ideal, there is no convincing evidence of systemic failures that impede access to finance for large firms or for resource-related projects in Australia. – EFIC should not continue to provide facilities to large corporate clients or for resource-related projects in Australia, including suppliers to those projects, on the commercial account.
• Financial markets may be affected by information-related failures. These are likely to be limited to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with limited export experience or attempting to access emerging export markets.
• Accordingly, EFIC’s role should be to demonstrate to the private sector that providing export finance to such newly exporting SMEs can be commercially viable.
• To fulfil this demonstration role, EFIC should provide export finance services on the same basis as the private sector. This means:– setting prices to cover the expected full economic costs of provision; and– being subject to competitive neutrality arrangements, including earning an appropriate return on equity, setting prices commensurate with risk, and paying a tax-equivalent charge and a debt neutrality fee.
• EFIC’s commercial account product range should normally be limited to guarantees, including the provision of bonds on behalf of the exporter.– When directed by the Minister, the product range may extend to reinsurance for a limited period, to cover sovereign and country risk insurance provided to newly exporting SMEs by the private sector, when financial markets in the buyer’s country are temporarily disrupted.
• Measures should be introduced to enhance the transparency of EFIC’s activities to the Minister, the Australian Government and the public"

819,Decoupling natural resource use and environmental impacts from economic growth,"By 2050, humanity could devour an estimated 140 billion tons of minerals, ores, fossil fuels and biomass per year – three times its current appetite – unless the economic growth rate is “decoupled” from the rate of natural resource consumption. 
Developed countries citizens consume an average of 16 tons of those four key resources per capita (ranging up to 40 or more tons per person in some developed countries). By comparison, the average person in India today consumes four tons per year.
With the growth of both population and prosperity, especially in developing countries, the prospect of much higher resource consumption levels is “far beyond what is likely sustainable” if realized at all given finite world resources, warns this report by UNEP’s International Resource Panel.
Already the world is running out of cheap and high quality sources of some essential materials such as oil, copper and gold, the supplies of which, in turn, require ever-rising volumes of fossil fuels and freshwater to produce. Improving the rate of resource productivity (“doing more with less”) faster than the economic growth rate is the notion behind “decoupling,” the panel says.
That goal, however, demands an urgent rethink of the links between resource use and economic prosperity, buttressed by a massive investment in technological, financial and social innovation, to at least freeze per capita consumption in wealthy countries and help developing nations follow a more sustainable path"
820,Investigating general practice and hepatitis B,"There is an increasing burden on the community resulting from chronic hepatitis B infection. General Practitioners (GPs) are essential in reducing this burden given strong evidence showing that the early detection, follow-up and treatment of chronic hepatitis B can slow the progression to liver failure and reduce the chance of being diagnosed with liver cancer. The Australian National Hepatitis B Strategy 2010-2013 describes ‘general practice as part of a healthcare team... central to the healthcare experience of people living with chronic hepatitis B.’ Given indications of a less than optimal response to chronic hepatitis B by GPs in Australia, this study conducted qualitative interviews with 26 GPs to identify their understanding of their role, and perspectives on the barriers and challenges to the effective diagnosis and management of chronic hepatitis B in general practice.

The GPs who participated in the study had been practicing for between three and 37 years with most working for ten years or more, and eight having practiced for over 30 years. About two-thirds of the participants communicated with their patients in at least one language other than English, with most speaking one or several Chinese languages, and Vietnamese. The number of patients with chronic hepatitis B cared for by the GPs was estimated to range from at least four patients, with 13 GPs caring for over 30 patients, including five GPs who cared for more than 100 patients.

Participants recognised the fundamental role GPs have in managing chronic hepatitis B with several stating that as a primary provider of health care in the community, GPs are uniquely positioned to support the screening and life-long monitoring of the infection. The recurring interaction between GPs and patients can lead to the establishment of trusting therapeutic relationships that often continue after patients have been referred to a tertiary service.

GP knowledge about chronic hepatitis B was identified as a key challenge for providing an effective clinical response. Almost all GPs identified a need for further education. Knowledge deficits related to the changes in specialist practices over the past decade as a result of a better understanding of the natural history of hepatitis B and improved treatment modalities"
821,Benchmarking opex and capex in energy networks,"The working paper Benchmarking Opex and Capex in Energy Networks reviews five alternative benchmarking methods – namely partial performance indicators, indexnumber-based total factor productivity, econometric method, stochastic frontier analysis, and data envelopment analysis – with a particular focus on their use in the benchmarking and regulation of energy networks.

The search for better ways of regulating energy utilities has increasingly included ‘cost benchmarking’, where the reasonableness of costs proposed is assessed against those of other utilities or even against costs estimated in economic-engineering models. Benchmarking has been applied in a large and increasing number of countries across the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in relation to both operating expenditure (opex) and capital expenditure (capex); particularly for distribution service operators in both the electricity and gas sub-sectors.

In Australia, there has long been interest in this approach, stretching back at the state level to the late 1990s. Currently the Australian Energy Regulator (AER) must have reference to the costs of an ‘efficient operator’ in a revenue or price determination. Further, interest in benchmarking has been heightened recently by two major inquiries; one by the Productivity Commission (PC) on benchmarking; and the other, by the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC), in relation to proposed rule changes"
822,The effectiveness of educational technology,"According to a recently released report by the U.S. Department of Education (SETDA,  2010), American teenagers are still trailing behind their counterparts in other industrialized  countries in their academic performance, especially in mathematics.
In the most recent PISA  assessments, U.S. 15-year-olds had an average mathematics score below the average of countries  in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Among the 33 other  OECD countries, over half had higher average scores than the U.S., 5 had lower average scores,  and 11 had average scores that were not substantially different than the U.S.  Similar patterns  were found in tests given in 2003 and 2006.   Importantly, the problem of students’ performance in mathematics is not equally  distributed.
While many middle class schools in the U.S. do perform at world class standards,  poor and minority students are much less likely to do so.  On the 2009 National Assessment of  Educational Progress (NAEP, 2009), only 17% of eighth graders eligible for free lunch scored at  proficient or better, while 45% of middle class students scored this well.  Among African  American students, only 12% scored proficient or better, and the percentages were 17% for  Hispanics and 18% for American Indians, compared to 44% for Whites and 54% for AsianAmericans. All of these scores have been improving over time, but the gaps remain"
823,Learning mathematics,"The question of whether or not the use of digital technologies can help to improve mathematics learning is less important than how the technologies can be used to benefit learning, states Gerry White in DERN.
.
Over the last 30 years, there have been numerous reviews of studies that have focussed on learning mathematics using technology. A rigorous large scale review of studies confirming that digital technologies can be used to improve mathematics learning could put the matter to rest.
A thorough meta-analysis about using technology to learn mathematics has been published by theCenter for Research and Reform in Education&nbsp;at John Hopkins University in the US and is available from the&nbsp;Best Evidence Encyclopedia. The study,&nbsp;The Effectiveness of Educational Technology Applications for Enhancing Mathematics Achievement in K-12 Classrooms: A Meta-Analysis&nbsp;is comprehensive and detailed. The research findings contain no surprises and confirm what is already known by stating that, ‘The majority of reviews concluded that there were positive effects of educational technology on mathematics achievement’ (p. 3).
A comprehensive literature review of published papers and unpublished reports written between 1970 and 2011 located 700 studies for further scrutiny. Studies were included if they evaluated any type of technology, were K-12 focussed, used rigorous quantitative research methods, were undertaken for longer than 12 weeks and were replicable in schools. The cull of preliminary studies found 74 that qualified for ‘final analysis with a total sample size of 56,886 K-12 students: 45 elementary studies (N=31,555) and 29 secondary studies (N=25,331)’ (p. 11). The meta-analysis modelled variations for methodological differences and substantive features of the studies such as ‘grade levels, types of educational technology programs, program intensity, level of implementation and socio-economic status’ (p. 9). However, high quality experimental studies on the use of interactive whiteboards could not be found.
&nbsp;
The study found that ‘educational technology had a more positive effect on elementary students than secondary students’ (p. 15) and that ‘supplemental technology programs produced the largest effect size’ (p15) provided that they were used for more than 30 minutes per week. No differences were found between schools serving low socio-economic status students and high socio-economic status students, and although in more recent years technology has become much more advanced ‘recent reviews are consistent in failing to find improvements over time in effects of technology on learning’ (19). This means that more sophisticated technologies and more teacher acceptance of technology in recent years has shown negligible further positive increases in the effect on learning. However, this is not a comment on the flexibility and convenience afforded by technology nor the capacity that technology enables to access learning resources.
&nbsp;
The study,&nbsp;The Effectiveness of Educational Technology Applications for Enhancing Mathematics Achievement in K-12 Classrooms: A Meta-Analysis&nbsp;concludes that the issue that needs to be addressed in education is ‘how best to incorporate various educational technology applications into classroom settings’ (p. 20) and states that ‘educational technology is making a modest difference in [the] learning of mathematics’ (p. 20). This is a seminal study that confirms the beneficial use of technology for learning and emphasises the need for research into how best to use technology for learning.

824,Schools workforce,"Australia\u27s future will depend on how well it develops the ‘human capital’ of its population. 

A well-performing schooling system is fundamental. It benefits individuals, the functioning and cohesion of society and the performance of the economy.

The importance of school education has increased with the shift to a more knowledge-based economy. Australia’s schooling system generally delivers good, though not outstanding, outcomes at reasonable cost. The foundation skills of the ‘average’ Australian student are at the upper end of international rankings, while total expenditure on school education, as a percentage of gross domestic product, is marginally below the OECD average. However, other aspects of school performance point to a need for improvement.

&nbsp;


	Despite an increase in spending per student and falling class sizes, there is evidence that student literacy and numeracy have declined in recent years, and that Australia has fallen behind other high-performing countries. &nbsp;
	Australia does not perform as well as comparable countries in giving students equal opportunity to realise their educational potential, irrespective of their background or ability.The resulting educational disadvantage is particularly evident among Australian students who are Indigenous, from low socioeconomic backgrounds, have a disability or other special needs, or reside in a rural or remote area. To raise student outcomes, there will need to be an improvement in the effectiveness and efficiency of teachers and other school workers.&nbsp;
	A more effective schools workforce would achieve better student outcomes, and a more efficient one would achieve a greater improvement from any given level of resources. In this report, the Productivity Commission proposes a package of reforms that gives priority to improving teacher quality, reducing teacher shortages, ameliorating educational disadvantage, and strengthening the use of evaluation and research in policy making.


&nbsp;Many of the recommended reforms would raise the attractiveness of teaching as a profession, and so help to turn around the widely held perception that the status of teachers has declined.

825,People and the planet,"The 21 st  century is a critical period for people and the  planet. The global population reached 7 billion during  2011 and the United Nations projections indicate  that it will reach between 8 and 11 billion by 2050.
Human impact on the Earth raises serious concerns,  and in the richest parts of the world per capita  material consumption is far above the level that can  be sustained for everyone in a population of 7 billion  or more. This is in stark contrast to the world’s 1.3  billion poorest people, who need to consume more  in order to be raised out of extreme poverty. The highest fertility rates are now seen primarily in  the least developed countries while the lowest fertility  rates are seen in the more developed countries,  and increasingly in Asia and Latin America. Despite  a decline in fertility almost everywhere, global  population is still growing at about 80 million per  year, because of the demographic momentum  inherent in a large cohort of young people.
The global  rate of population growth is already declining, but  the poorest countries are neither experiencing, nor  benefiting from, this decline. Population and consumption are both important:  the combination of increasing global population  and increasing overall material consumption has  implications for a finite planet. As both continue to  rise, signs of unwanted impacts and feedback (eg  climate change reducing crop yields in some areas)  and of irreversible changes (eg the increased rate  of species extinction) are growing alarmingly.
The  relationship between population, consumption and  the environment is not straightforward, as the natural  environment and human socioeconomic systems  are complex in their own right. The Earth’s capacity  to meet human needs is finite, but how the limits  are approached depends on lifestyle choices and  associated consumption; these depend on what is  used, and how, and what is regarded as essential for  human wellbeing"
826,Barriers to effective climate change adaptation,"This draft report was released to assist participants in preparing a submission to the public inquiry into Barriers to Effective Climate Change Adaptation. 

Climate change adaptation is action by households, firms, other organisations and governments to respond to the impacts of climate change that cannot be avoided through climate change mitigation efforts. An effective national adaptation response will require all levels of government, the private sector and intermediary markets to contribute to that response.

This inquiry will assist COAG to advance climate change adaptation reforms in Australia by examining the policy frameworks required to facilitate effective adaptation, and the costs and benefits of various adaptation options so as to identify the highest priority reforms. In undertaking this review the Commission will also assess the effectiveness and efficiency of market based approaches in facilitating adaptation"
827,"Urban informatics: research and insights for libraries, cultural industries and innovation systems","Over less than a decade, we have witnessed a seismic shift in the way  knowledge is produced and exchanged. This is opening up new  opportunities for civic and community engagement, entrepreneurial  behaviour, sustainability initiatives and creative practices. It also  has the potential to create fresh challenges in areas of privacy,  cyber-security and misuse of data and personal information.
The field  of urban informatics focuses on the use and impacts of digital media  technology in urban environments. Urban informatics is a dynamic and  cross-disciplinary area of inquiry that encapsulates social media,  ubiquitous computing, mobile applications and location-based services.  Its insights suggest the emergence of a new economic force with the  potential for driving innovation, wealth and prosperity through  technological advances, digital media and online networks that affect  patterns of both social and economic development.
Urban informatics  explores the intersections between people, place and technology, and  their implications for creativity, innovation and engagement. This paper  examines how the key learnings from this field can be used to position  creative and cultural institutions such as galleries, libraries,  archives and museums (GLAM) to take advantage of the opportunities  presented by these changing social and technological developments.
This  paper introduces the underlying principles, concepts and research areas  of urban informatics, against the backdrop of modern knowledge  economies. Both theoretical ideas and empirical examples are covered in  this paper.
The first part discusses three challenges:
a. People, and  the challenge of creativity: The paper explores the opportunities and  challenges of urban informatics that can lead to the design and  development of new tools, methods and applications fostering  participation, the democratisation of knowledge, and new creative  practices.
b. Technology, and the challenge of innovation: The paper  examines how urban informatics can be applied to support user-led  innovation with a view to promoting entrepreneurial ideas and creative  industries.
c. Place, and the challenge of engagement: The paper  discusses the potential to establish place-based applications of urban  informatics, using the example of library spaces designed to deliver  community and civic engagement strategies.
The discussion of these  challenges is illustrated by a review of projects as examples drawn from  diverse fields such as urban computing, locative media, community  activism, and sustainability initiatives.
The second part of the  paper introduces an empirically grounded case study that responds to  these three challenges: The Edge, the Queensland Government’s Digital  Culture Centre which is an initiative of the State Library of Queensland  to explore the nexus of technology and culture in an urban environment.  The paper not only explores the new role of libraries in the knowledge  economy, but also how the application of urban informatics in prototype  engagement spaces such as The Edge can provide transferable insights  that can inform the design and development of responsive and inclusive  new library spaces elsewhere.
To set the scene and background, the  paper begins by drawing the bigger picture and outlining some key  characteristics of the knowledge economy and the role that the creative  and cultural industries play in it, grasping new opportunities that can  contribute to the prosperity of Australia"
828,"Demographic change and local development: shrinkage, regeneration and social dynamics","Countries across the world are affected in different ways by demographic change at the local level. For example, decline in the urban population due to suburbanisation and de-industrialisation, has resulted in a wide range of socio-economic issues (e.g. increased unemployment rate, decrease in revenue, degradation of properties). As a result of falling fertility rates, many cities and regions in OECD member countries are likely to continue to “shrink” in the coming decades, even with some increases in population due to migration (from within or from outside the country).

&nbsp;

Demographic change is one of the key challenges today for local development together with globalisation, knowledge/technological shift, climate change and the development of the green economy, inclusiveness and poverty. Strategic solutions cannot be based on addressing one of these factors alone but must take into account the interplay of these elements within a particular local area of development (urban or rural). At the same time that there are important challenges to be addressed, there are also opportunities to be fostered such as the development of the “silver” economy of older entrepreneurs, the “white” economy for medical services for the elderly population, or the natural “green” advantage of shrinking areas. However, policy responses are still fragmented and there is no articulation of a sustainable answer to ensure and increase the quality of life in the light of these changes.

In order to succeed in addressing the challenges associated with demographic change, it cannot be left to the market alone to find a solution, effective policy interventions are needed. A multi-disciplinary approach with a long-term perspective is crucial and all actors (government, social partners, community organisations, etc.) need to share responsibilities. There is a need for new ways of thinking regarding ageing and older workers’ output to overcome some of the expected challenges and to ensure financing of services that are likely to increase, with the growth of an ageing population, but a declining resource base (OECD, 2011a).

This report presents chapters detailing cases from 20 countries divided under the following sections: community shrinkage and sustainability, regeneration strategies for communities, and the social dynamics of demographic change.

829,Award-reliant small businesses,"This paper seeks to increase the understanding of the impact of award wage increases on small businesses in Australia by providing an analysis of the characteristics and performance of small award-reliant businesses and their employees.
Results derived from firm level data showed that small award-reliant only businesses were less likely to experience increased productivity, profitability and remain viable over time relative to other businesses. Data on employees found that award-reliant employees in small businesses resembled award-reliant workers in larger businesses more than non-award-reliant workers in small businesses.
This analysis, including the scope of the paper, could have been improved with better firm level data in the form of a Linked Employer-Employee Dataset, as data limitations prevent empirical testing of the potential impact of adjustments made to award wages on small businesses"

Very little information is available separately for Australian Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders, but, wherever possible, separate information has been provided"
831,Community attitudes to people with disability: scoping project,"This paper is an initial step towards building an evidence base on Australian community attitudes to people with disability, on the impact of these attitudes on outcomes for people with disability and on effective policies for improving community attitudes towards them.

In this context, ‘outcome’ refers to the experiences of people with disability as measured by social policy indicators within the domains of education, employment, community and social participation, health and wellbeing, housing and access to support services.

People with disability and their families and carers have reported the effects of negative attitudes towards disability across all life domains; further evidence of these effects includes the experiences of discrimination reported to the Australian Human Rights Commission and constant investments by governments in efforts to change community attitudes. The need to address attitudes was featured in the reports of the consultations for both the National Disability Strategy and the National Mental Health and Disability Employment Strategy (Deane 2009; DEEWR 2009).

FaHCSIA commissioned the SPRC to conduct a scoping project investigating current research on community attitudes towards people with disability"
832,"Water quality, biodiversity and codes of practice in relation to harvesting forest plantations in streamside management zones","This report examines important streamside management zone processes and illustrates them with examples from forest management operations and agriculture.

Streamside management zones (SMZs) are special landscape units that include riparian areas and adjacent lands that mitigate the movement of sediment, nutrients and other chemicals from upland forest and agricultural management areas into streams. The size, shape, and management of SMZs are governed by various combinations of economic, ecological, and regulatory factors. Although SMZs used around the world have a wide range of widths, in many cases they are similar at 5-20 m.

Streamside management zones are important barriers or treatment areas that protect water resources from non-point source pollution. Vegetation and the geomorphic characteristics of SMZs result in infiltration, filtering, and deposition from sediment- and nutrient-laden water flowing off intensively managed forestry, agriculture, and urban lands. The effectiveness of SMZs for trapping sediment depends upon the velocity of water flow, size distribution of sediments, slope and length of slope above the SMZ, slope and length of the SMZ itself, depth of water flow into the SMZ, and vegetation characteristics such as type, density, and height. Nutrient removal is a function of SMZ width, runoff water residence time in the SMZ, the vigor of SMZ vegetation, and the amount of runoff water infiltrated into the soil during its transit of the SMZ.

833,What are the options? Pricing and taxation policy reforms to redress excessive alcohol consumption and related harms in Australia,"Increasing community and political concern about excessive alcohol consumption and related harms in Australia has prompted calls for the introduction of tighter regulatory controls. From an evidence-based, research perspective, measures which increase alcohol prices and taxes, in particular, are considered most effective for reducing alcohol consumption and related harms. Accordingly, this report presents a review of pricing and taxation policy levers that have been considered and/or implemented nationally and internationally. These policies include: alcohol taxation and differential price by beverage; special/additional taxation on alcopops; minimum pricing; and bans on price discounts and promotions. Industry response to these policy initiatives is discussed, in addition to the role of public opinion in policy-making, and the issue of substitution and complementarity with other drugs. This review is designed to inform policymakers of useful taxation and pricing policy levers to redress alcohol-related harm in the Australian community. We conclude that each policy holds some promise, and it appears that they would be more successful when used in combination than as individual uncoordinated strategies"
834,An examination of the characteristics and time use of those who have unfilled spare time,"While the often-heard complaint about time today is that of having too much to do and too little time, there are those who experience the opposite: they have difficulty filling the spare time that they have. This spare time can for some include times perceived to be empty of satisfying activity, and instead be associated with feelings of dissatisfaction, with frustration and boredom, and with time being spent in unproductive or even unhealthy pursuits. This paper uses the Australian Bureau of Statistics 1997 and 2006 Time Use Surveys to examine the characteristics and time use patterns associated with reporting to frequently have spare time that is difficult to fill. These analyses take a life cycle perspective to determine which men and women are at greatest risk of having this experience of time. These findings indicate that while a minority of people experience unfilled spare time, it is more common among the youngest men and women, especially those living with their parents, as well as men living alone, men and women with limited commitments to paid work or to caring, and those with a health problem and with a non-English-language background. Examining the reasons given for having unfilled spare time, lack of money is the main reason given, however other reasons also apply, and reasons differ for particular groups of people. Ill health, transport, having no friends or family nearby and lack of community facilities are some of those reasons. These data were also related to the patterns of time use to better understand the implications of having unfilled spare time for individuals\u27 wellbeing.

835,Economic structure and performance of the Australian retail industry,"According to this report, regulatory reforms are needed for the Australian retail industry to adapt successfully to the more globally competitive market in which it now operates.


	There are almost 140 000 retail businesses in Australia, accounting for 4.1 per cent of GDP and 10.7 per cent of employment.
	The retail industry exhibits great diversity by: size of business, region, retail format, competition within sectors and in the nature of goods sold. Both current trading conditions and longer term trends are challenging. Retail sales growth has trended down over the past half decade as consumers save more of their rising incomes and their spending is increasingly directed towards a range of non-retail services.
	The retail industry has met many competitive challenges in the past. Online retailing and the entry of new innovative global retailers are just the latest. The intensified competition is good for consumers, but is challenging for the industry which, as a whole, does not compare favourably in terms of productivity with many overseas countries. And the productivity gap appears to have widened over time.
	Australia also appears to lag a number of comparable countries in its development of online retailing. The Commission\u27s best estimate is that online retailing represents 6 per cent of total Australian retail sales - made up of 4 per cent domestic online ($8.4 billion) and 2 per cent from overseas ($4.2 billion). In some other countries, online sales figures are higher and set to grow further, as will also happen here.
	Retailers operate under several regulatory regimes that restrict their competitiveness and ability to innovate. Major restrictions which need to be addressed are:
	
		planning and zoning regulations which are complex, excessively prescriptive, and often anticompetitive
		trading hours regulations which restrict the industry\u27s ability to adapt and compete with online competitors and provide the convenience that consumers want.
	
	
	Workplace relations regulations may not provide sufficient workplace flexibility to facilitate the adoption of best practice productivity measures in the retail industry, and require examination in the reviews scheduled in 2012.
	The current level of the low value threshold (LVT) for exemption from GST and duty on imports of $1000 is judged to be a minor part of the competitive disadvantage faced by retailers. But there are strong in principle grounds for the LVT to be lowered significantly, to promote tax neutrality with domestic sales. However, the Government should not proceed to lower the LVT until it is cost effective to do so.
	The Government should establish a taskforce charged with investigating new approaches to the processing of low value imported parcels, particularly those in the international mail stream, and recommending a new process which would deliver significant improvements and efficiencies in handling without creating delivery delays or other compliance difficulties for importers and consumers.
	Once an improved international parcels process has been designed, the Government should reassess the extent to which the LVT could be lowered while still remaining cost effective - the costs of raising this additional revenue should be at least broadly comparable to the costs of raising other taxes.

836,"Community engagement, partnerships and research into policy and practice: a literature review","This literature review looks at community engagement and academic research with a particular emphasis on public health issues. 

Community engagement is a term that has come to be associated with a broad range of activities involving the interaction of universities and researchers with communities. In the health field, there has been a particular recognition of the role of community engagement in research (establishing research objectives, jointly undertaking research, and sharing the roles in the reporting and dissemination of research findings).

More broadly, universities and researchers have been engaged in building local, national and international partnerships with communities, community-based organisations, NGOs, social services and practitioners, other researchers/institutions and government to conduct research or community-based projects.

The purposes of community engagement and partnerships in research are generally to improve the quality of the research itself and, through this, to promote positive changes in people’s lives. The latter involves dissemination of results in a variety of formats to a range of stakeholders, and engagement/advocacy to effect changes in policy and practice. The process, outcomes and impact of these sorts of research and activities are understood and described in a range of ways.

The following paper presents a literature review with the aims of:


	defining the range of terms and concepts that describe the engagement of researchers with society, communities, social services and government,
	focusing on both the process and impact of these sorts of research, and
	investigating ways of measuring and valuing research that involves community engagement, partnerships and influences changes in policy and practice.


The review was based on a detailed literature search across several databases. This is not a systematic review but provides a broad overview of the international and local literature"
837,Therapeutic residential care in Australia: taking stock and looking forward,"Therapeutic residential care is becoming an increasingly relevant out-of-home care option for children and young people with multiple and complex needs. 

It is a new and developing approach in Australia, one aimed not simply at containment of the “hard cases” - as is often the case in traditional residential care—but rather at actively facilitating healing and recovery from the effects of abuse, neglect and separation from family. In this Issues Paper, therapeutic residential care is described and contrasted with other models of out-of-home care. The theory and evidence supporting the use of this form of care are examined and used to develop a set of key elements, which, it is argued, should guide the provision of therapeutic residential care in Australia.

Following the move towards deinstitutionalisation in the second half of the last century, residential care was a mainstay placement option for children and young people who were unable to remain with their family due to protective concerns. More recently, however, it has become a last resort, used when other approaches, such as family support and/or foster care, have not been successful. Young people who display highly challenging and disruptive behaviours, such as those associated with conduct disorders, neuro-developmental problems and mental illness, are most often referred to residential care in order to avoid them harming themselves or others.

There is, however, an increasing understanding that these young people’s histories are often littered with experiences of abuse, neglect and multiple placement breakdowns, which can hinder their ability to build trusting relationships with others. Many of these young people show signs of complex trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder, which contribute to their maladaptive behaviours and emotions. Consequently, there is a growing shift to move beyond a traditional residential model of daily care and accommodation to a needs-based model of care that addresses the challenges posed by these young people’s often compromised and complex developmental needs.

This growing interest in how best to offer a healing, therapeutic environment within the context of residential care led to a proposal to hold a national workshop, which was endorsed by the Community and Disability Services Ministers’ Advisory Council (CDSMAC) in late 2009. The National Therapeutic Residential Care Workshop was subsequently held in Melbourne in September 2010. The workshop brought practitioners and service providers together with researchers and government policy-makers. This paper draws on the proceedings of that workshop, Australian and international literature, and information about current models offered by jurisdictions within Australia to provide a picture of the increasing investment in therapeutic residential care and the key elements that characterise this model of care"
838,"Public risk perceptions, understandings, and responses to climate change in Australia and Great Britain","&nbsp; Notwithstanding the seeming ever-fluctuating public concern levels with respect to the threat and impacts of ‘climate change’ around the world, there exists a more consistent and coherent evidence base suggesting that public concern about climate change remains quite high, both in Australia and overseas. This interim report provides an initial look at the national survey findings of a collaborative and cross-national research project by Griffith University (Australia) and Cardiff University (Wales) examining public risk perceptions, understandings and responses to the threat and unfolding impacts of climate change in Australia and Great Britain. Each of these surveys, in addition to shared questions and objectives, had additional and differing objectives, with the Australian survey also examining public perceptions, experience, and responses to natural disasters, and the British survey examining energy policies and futures in the United Kingdom. The Australian national survey was undertaken between 6 June and 6 July of 2010 and involved a geographically and demographically stratified national sample of 3096 respondents. The British survey was undertaken between 6 January and 26 March, 2010 and involved a representative quota sample of 1822 respondents residing in England, Scotland and Wales. This interim report addresses common findings relating to these two interlinked surveys, and in addition provides some additional and preliminary information regarding the Australia-specific questions and findings from the Australian survey exercise. These surveys are distinctive in their cross-national comparative collaboration, in their in-depth nature, in their focus on underlying public understandings and psychological responses to climate change, and in their shared objective of documenting and monitoring important psychological and social changes and impacts in the human landscape relating to global climate change.

839,"Which event matters: exploring the relationship between life events, socioeconomic status and psychological distress in mothers of infants","&nbsp;

Psychological distress is an important component of the overall health and wellbeing of individuals. It also represents a risk factor for illnesses such as depression. In mothers, psychological distress has been linked with poorer outcomes, both for the mother and her child. This study explored the relationship between stressful events and psychological distress in mothers of infants.

Using 4,247 mothers of infants from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children, it was found that certain subpopulations of Australian mothers, such as young mothers, lone mothers and unemployed mothers, were at an increased risk of reporting psychological distress. In addition, mothers with high distress were more likely than mothers with low distress to report experiencing at least one stressful event within the past 12 months. The study also found that although the number of stressful events predicted the likelihood of psychological distress, certain events were more strongly associated with high distress than others. These included relationship separation, work disappointment and financial crisis"

841,Policing licensed premises in the Australian Capital Territory,"The effectiveness of policing strategies directed at reducing and preventing alcohol-related violence in licensed premises and entertainment precincts in the Australian Capital Territory are evaluated in this report.

There is an old joke that says that an Australian’s&nbsp;definition of a drinking problem is being in a situation&nbsp;where you can’t get a drink. This reﬂects Australia’s&nbsp;well-established reputation for being a community&nbsp;where the consumption of alcohol, frequently at&nbsp;excessive and harmful levels, is associated with&nbsp;many forms of entertainment and participation&nbsp;in social events. In other words, the association&nbsp;between alcohol consumption and the enjoyment&nbsp;of social activity is a deeply embedded cultural&nbsp;phenomenon.

However, the evidence relating to the range of&nbsp;individual and social harms associated with alcohol&nbsp;misuse is strong. In 2007, one in four Australians&nbsp;were a victim of alcohol-related verbal abuse,&nbsp;13 percent were put in fear and 4.5 percent of&nbsp;Australians aged 14 years or older had been&nbsp;physically abused by someone under the inﬂuence&nbsp;of alcohol (AIHW 2008). The rates of physical and&nbsp;verbal abuse by a person affected by alcohol&nbsp;are more than twice the rate for other drug types.&nbsp;

Alcohol-related crime and disorder also has a&nbsp;significant adverse impact upon the perceptions&nbsp;of safety among the broader community. At the same time, Australia also has a substantial&nbsp;reputation for developing and implementing&nbsp;innovative policy approaches to trying to reduce the&nbsp;harms associated with excessive alcohol use and&nbsp;violence in particular. Many of these initiatives have&nbsp;been focused on regulatory responses that target&nbsp;licensed premises and liquor outlets. Licensed&nbsp;premises are a high-risk setting for alcohol-related&nbsp;violence, with a large proportion of assaults&nbsp;occurring in or within very close proximity to hotels&nbsp;and nightclubs. Furthermore, both patrons and staff&nbsp;of licensed premises are at a heightened risk of&nbsp;becoming involved in a violent incident compared&nbsp;with other locations.

Over the years, police and liquor regulatory&nbsp;authorities, often in partnership with liquor licensees,&nbsp;have committed significant effort and resources&nbsp;to efforts to improve the overall safety of drinking&nbsp;venues and the overall amenity of the nearby&nbsp;community. Unfortunately, often what has been&nbsp;missing from such efforts has been any systematic&nbsp;assessment of their relative effectiveness and&nbsp;methods for sharing the lessons learned.&nbsp;

This report is part of an attempt to redress this&nbsp;knowledge deficit. Undertaken in close partnership&nbsp;with Australian Capital Territory Policing (ACTP), the&nbsp;project was a detailed study of the effectiveness of&nbsp;a series of policing measures implemented by the&nbsp;ACTP over several months to reduce and prevent&nbsp;alcohol-related violence in and around licensed&nbsp;premises and entertainment precincts in the ACT.

As with similar studies previously conducted here&nbsp;and overseas, the project found mixed results in&nbsp;relation to effectiveness. However, the project was&nbsp;able to help identify and explain what things were&nbsp;working and why, thereby providing a series of&nbsp;evidence-based recommendations for future policing&nbsp;in this area, many of which it is pleasing to note have&nbsp;already been adopted by ACTP.

844,Views of young people in detention centres: Queensland 2011,"Giving  young people the opportunity to share their views and experiences of detention and the youth justice system, this survey considers matters that affect their safety and wellbeing. 
The Commission’s latest survey  shows that young people in  Queensland’s youth detention centres are positive  about many aspects of  their safety and  wellbeing. For instance, most young people report  feeling well treated on their  arrival in detention, feeling safe,  getting high quality health care, and benefiting  from a wide range of  programs.
The survey also points to areas that require further   investigation, including claims of derogatory language being used by  some youth  workers toward young people, and the high proportion of  young people who report  being subject to separation and restraint  during their stay in detention.
Young people’s responses to this survey have also  highlighted  opportunities to enhance the quality of care provided to  young people in  detention. These include increasing the use of  video-conferencing technology to  maintain regular family contact,  introducing additional health checks-ups, and  improving young people’s  engagement in aftercare programs through a focus on  practical elements  like work, training, sport and social networking.

845,For kids&#039; sake: repairing the social environment for Australian children and young people,"The wellbeing of many children had deteriorated in the past 10 to 15 years. 

For very good reasons, Australians of all ages, backgrounds and political persuasions are concerned about the environment. What we do now in terms of looking after the environment will affect the nation not only in the present, but for generations to come. Rightly, we are thinking about what legacy we are going to leave our children, and their children, in terms of the natural world on which we all depend.

However little attention has been paid to the social environment in which our children are growing up, and the dangers that the deterioration of this environment presents for the future. Indeed, many of us may not even be aware of how bad things are becoming.

One of the reasons is that any report card on the wellbeing of the nation’s children is likely to be mixed. Australia remains the Lucky Country in many respects. The wellbeing of Australian children has improved on a number of measures in the last decade or so, in particular in terms of physical and economic wellbeing. Yet overall levels of wellbeing, and even upward trends for the majority of the population, can disguise increasingly serious problems for many children. When the position of the nation’s most troubled children and young people is considered, there are indications that all is not well, and that on numerous measures, the situation is deteriorating at an extraordinarily rapid pace. There has also been a decline, more generally, in the psychological wellbeing of young people. As a society, we may be healthier and wealthier than a generation ago, but contentment has proved much more elusive"

848,Strengthening palliative care: policy and strategic directions 2011 – 2015,"&nbsp;

This policy&nbsp;will guide the work of palliative care services, consortia and government from 2011 to 2015. The actions outlined in this policy will equip specialist palliative care services in Victoria to meet growing demand for palliative care.

&nbsp;

The Department of Health (DH) provides funds for specialist palliative care services to operate throughout the state of Victoria.

While general health care services are often involved in the care of people with a terminal illness, the Palliative Care Program provides specialist services that address specific issues such as the management of pain and other symptoms associated with a terminal illness and to provide psychological, social and spiritual support where required or if requested.

The Palliative Care Program aims to achieve an integrated service across all aspects of care. This is supported by the underlying principles of the Palliative Care Program, which are:


	Care is holistic, multidisciplinary and client-centred;
	Care includes medical, nursing, allied health and volunteer services;
	Support is provided for families and friends, including grief and bereavement support;
	Patients can make informed choices about their care including the type of care and where the care is delivered; and
	Service delivery is seamless between the locations where care is delivered, whether that be in the community or in a health care facility.

849,Integrated resource planning for urban water - resource papers,"&nbsp;

The Australian urban water industry faces significant challenges&nbsp;in meeting growing demands on urban water resources under a shifting climate.

Through this project,&nbsp;National Water Commission, in partnership with Water Services Association of Australia (WSAA), identified several important areas where nationally coordinated action would benefit the Australian urban water sector and progress commitments made under the National Water Initiative.

Objectives of this project were to:


	build capacity and improve planning by urban water utilities by developing resources that support best practice urban water supply and demand planning
	create resources specifically targeting the water planning needs of regional and smaller urban water utilities and local councils, where resources and skills can often be in scarce supply
	provide resources that will assist the urban water utility sector and local government water managers to better incorporate community values and public benefits as part of their water planning and investment decisions
	support water managers and utilities to start the complex task of incorporating climate change into water supply and demand planning.


This project has developed a new Integrated Resource Planning model for water planners around Australia. This web-based tool can be applied to any urban water supply in Australia. A series of manuals is also available to guide practitioners, together with case studies that demonstrate the model\u27s use in two Australian cities"

851,"School readiness: what does it mean for Indigenous children, families, schools and communities?","Examining programs that work as well as the gaps in current knowledge about school readiness, this paper concentrates on the transition to school for Indigenous Australian children.

What we know
•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;School readiness is a multidimensional construct, recognising the interplay of children’s individual characteristics and the contexts in which they live, and have lived, as they grow and develop.
•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;School readiness incorporates three major components: – children’s readiness for school – schools’ readiness for children – the capacity of families and communities to provide the necessary opportunities, conditions and supports to optimise children’s development and learning.

What works
•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Schools that employ and value Indigenous staff provide ‘ready’ links between school, families and communities which can enhance the transition to school for Indigenous children.
•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Positive professional links and regular communication between prior-to-school educators and school educators support children’s transition to school.
•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Positive involvement of families and engagement with other community members in Indigenous children’s transition to school are important components of making a school ‘ready’.
•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;High-quality early childhood education helps prepare children for school.

What doesn’t work
•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;‘Lack of readiness’ is not a problem of children being insufficiently skilled to learn at school, but instead it is where there is a mismatch between the attributes of individual children and families, and the ability and resources of the school and/or system to engage and respond appropriately.
•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Assessment of Indigenous children through tests based in non-Indigenous culture can reinforce ‘gaps’ in knowledge and skills, rather than building positive images of Indigenous children as learners.

•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Approaches to readiness and transition to school that focus only on developing Indigenous children’s skills and not on broader factors such as schools, families and communities do not necessarily lead to improved school success.

What we don’t know
•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There is insufficient information on what Indigenous parents and communities understand by ‘readiness for school’.
•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There is no national agreement on what is important in terms of readiness for school, how to measure it and what the indicators of readiness might be.
•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We don’t know whether United States’ and other international interventions will work in Australia.
•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There is no solid evidence of benefits, particularly cost benefits, of many early childhood interventions in Australia.

852,Community policing in Australia,"An overview of what is currently known about community policing in Australia.

Topics covered include:


	Community Policing – the Australian connection
	The changing nature of communities: Implications for police and community policing
	A new movement in community policing? From community policing to vulnerable people policing
	Community policing in culturally and linguistically diverse communities
	Community policing in rural and remote Australia
	Aboriginal liaison officers in community policing
	Indigenous community policing: Building strength from within
	Police and crime prevention: Partnering with the community
	Harnessing information and communications technologies in community policing


Community policing occurs across many contexts and continues to be part of everyday policing practice, but it is especially challenging when the community is resistant or hostile and/or there is a personal or collective history of poor relations. The skills and knowledge required to undertake community policing successfully should be the subject of ongoing investigation and debate and greater celebration. The genesis of this report was a conference on policing in New Zealand in 2008. The contributors have all worked closely and collaboratively with police—in education and in the development of policing practice and community engagement, in policy and program management or on research projects.

The collection seeks to provide an overview of what is currently known about community policing in Australia and to encourage further research and analysis of the issues and challenges highlighted in the report.

854,How much do educational outcomes matter in OECD countries?,"This paper shows that cognitive skills can account for growth differences within the OECD, whereas a range of economic institutions and quantitative measures of tertiary education cannot.

Under the growth model estimates and plausible projection parameters, school improvements falling within currently observed performance levels yield very large gains. The present value of OECD aggregate gains through 2090 could be as much as $275 trillion, or 13.8 percent of the discounted value of future GDP. Extensive sensitivity analyses indicate that, while differences between model frameworks and alternative parameter choices make a difference, the economic impact of improved educational outcomes remains enormous. Interestingly, the quantitative difference between an endogenous and neoclassical model framework – with improved skills affecting the long-run growth rate versus just the steady-state income level – matters less than academic discussions suggest.

The paper closes with a discussion of the evidence on which education policy reforms may be able to bring about the simulated improvements in educational outcomes"
855,The provision of Commonwealth Rent Assistance to residents of non-standard forms of accommodation for older people,"Retirement-village residents may be disadvantaged by  current policy on eligibility for Commonwealth Rent Assistance, reports this paper examining potential inequities in rent assistance for older people across different types of housing. 
This report is concerned with policies on Commonwealth Rent  Assistance (CRA) for older people living in retirement villages,  manufactured home parks and caravan parks. There have been concerns that  eligibility criteria for CRA may have become inequitable across these  different forms of housing because of changes in costs and tenure  arrangements over the last decade.
The study was commissioned by the  Australian Government Department of Families, Housing, Community  Services and Indigenous Affairs (FaHCSIA) to inform CRA policy  development. It provides information on financial and tenure  arrangements in the different types of residential setting, and on the  socio-economic and financial circumstances of residents.
The research involved:
* a review of the literature;
* a telephone survey of operators of a national random sample of the three forms of non-standard accommodation; and
* a paper-based survey of residents in the village/park sample.
The  study found that since an earlier SPRC study carried out in 1998,  increases in the level of entry contributions in retirement villages  have outstripped the annual updating of the Extra Allowable Amount (EAA)  threshold which acts as the primary criterion for eligibility for CRA.  Only three per cent of retirement-village residents appeared to be  eligible on these grounds. The EAA criterion does not apply to MHP and  caravan park dwellers, but if it did a much higher proportion would be  eligible. Even allowing for over-representation of for-profit (and  therefore potentially higher cost) villages in the sample, over time the  costs of retirement-village entry are taking residents out of  eligibility for CRA.
Retirement-village residents in  particular are also subject to widely varying but often substantial  deferred management or departure fees, as well as retention by  management of a proportion of any capital gains. Most MHP residents, by  contrast, would normally retain all or most of the purchase price and  any capital growth on the value of their housing, although some would  appear to face significant departure fees too. Caravan park residents  are not normally subject to deferred management or departure fees.
On  the basis of these findings, there seems to be some justification for  the view that retirement-village residents may be disadvantaged by  current policy on eligibility for CRA compared to those in MHPs,  especially when deferred management and departure fees are taken into  account. Some retirement villages attract a higher income and higher  asset clientele that puts them clearly out of eligibility for CRA, but  for others their financial circumstances are similar to those of MHP  residents who pay lower departure fees (if any) and mostly retain  capital gain achieved on sales. MHP residents tend to pay significantly  higher recurrent charges than do retirement-village residents, but this  is often made up for by receipt of CRA.
Better-off  retirement-village residents were somewhat over-represented in the  survey sample, but even amongst these many were ‘asset-rich’ but still  ‘cash-poor’, especially once the costs of paying for additional and  often essential services were met. Even this asset base was often  undermined by deferred management fees, and there is a strong case for  great transparency and consistency across the retirement village sector  in the application of these fees.

856,"The evaluation of Brighter Futures, NSW Community Services&#039; early intervention program: final report","This report finds the NSW Community Services\u27 early intervention program, Brighter Futures, to be a success, while also identifying some teeting problems.

Brighter Futures is an innovative program, which has changed the practice of child abuse prevention services in NSW. The program has broken new ground nationally and internationally by developing an evidence-based service model; requiring caseworkers to use validated instruments for assessment and reporting; and being delivered through a cross-sectoral partnership between Community Services and non-government organisations. It is also innovative in specifically targeting families who are at most risk of entering the child protection system.

The Social Policy Research Centre (SPRC) at the University of New South Wales was commissioned to evaluate the program shortly after its state-wide rollout. SPRC worked in collaboration with researchers from the Centre for Health and Economics Research and Evaluation (CHERE) at the University of Technology, Sydney, who undertook the Economic Evaluation.

The results summarised in this document and detailed in the main report present a picture of program success. However as a consequence of evaluation timing, and the innovative nature of the program, teething problems associated with implementing a new program were identified. Evaluation findings were limited by the narrow timeframe with which we had been able to observe participant families following their exit from the program. Further tracking of participant families is possible as an avenue for future research.

Key findings for each component of the evaluation are provided throughout this report"
857,Patient-centred care: improving quality and safety by focusing care,"Patient-centred care is health care that is respectful of, and responsive to, the preferences, needs and values of patients and consumers. The widely accepted dimensions of patient-centred care are respect, emotional support, physical comfort, information and communication, continuity and transition, care coordination, involvement of family and carers, and access to care. Surveys measuring patients’ experience of health care are typically based on these domains.
Research demonstrates that patient-centred care improves patient care experience and creates public value for services. When healthcare administrators, providers, patients and families work in partnership, the quality and safety of health care rise, costs decrease, and provider satisfaction increases and patient care experience improves. Patient-centred care can also positively affect business metrics such as finances, quality, safety, satisfaction and market share.
Patient-centred care is recognised as a dimension of high-quality health care in its own right and is identified in the seminal Institute of Medicine report, Crossing the Quality Chasm, as one of the six quality aims for improving care. In recent years, strategies used in the US and UK to improve overall healthcare quality, such as public reporting and financial incentives, have emerged as policy-level drivers for improving patient-centred care.
In Australia, a patient-centred approach is supported by the Australian Charter of Healthcare Rights, the National Safety and Quality Framework, other national service standards, reports of state-based inquiries, and a range of jurisdictional and private sector initiatives.
Recent national health reform arrangements (such as the Performance and Accountability Framework of the 2010 National Health and Hospitals Network Agreement) provide further incentives to improve patient-centred care by linking it to performance and funding. Another driver for improving patient-centred care is the establishment of a National Performance Authority to report transparently on a range of performance indicators, including ‘patient satisfaction’ for every Local Hospital Network, public hospital, private hospital and primary healthcare organisation.
Against this background, Australian healthcare organisations are becoming increasingly interested in patient-centred care. Most organisations can readily put patient charters and informed consent policies in place, but many find it hard to actively change the way care is delivered, and struggle to involve patients and learn from their experience. Key strategies from leading patient-centred care organisations include demonstrating committed senior leadership; regular monitoring and reporting of patient feedback data; engaging patients, families and carers as partners; resourcing improvements in care delivery and environment; building staff capacity and a supportive work environment; establishing performance accountability; and supporting a learning organisation culture.
Internationally, healthcare services use a range of strategies to promote patient-centred care, including staff development, leadership, collecting and reporting patient feedback, redesigning and co-designing service delivery, implementing patient rights charters, and engaging patients and carers as partners in improving care. A range of international organisations provide frameworks and tools to help organisations implement these strategies, such as the US-based Institute for Patient- and Family-Centered Care, and Planetree.
Based on these strategies and frameworks (and taking into account Australia’s healthcare system, with its mix of public and private sectors), practical policy and service-level recommendations to foster patient-centred care are outlined in this discussion paper.

858,Inquiry into strategies to reduce assaults in public places,"Assaults in public places have become an increasing problem in Victoria over the last few years. This report provides a comprehensive survey of the current situation and community and government activities in this area.
On 29 July 2009 the Drugs and Crime Prevention Committee of the Victorian Parliament was asked to report on strategies to reduce crime against the person in Victoria and, in particular:
(a) the level, nature and incidence of crimes against the person in Victoria and the trends in recent years;
(b) the impact of these crimes on vulnerable groups, migrants, overseas students and the elderly;
(c) strategies to address these crimes and reduce their incidence and increase the apprehension and conviction of offenders;
(d) the role of community policing and local community organisations; and
(e) the level of police resources in Victoria and their distribution throughout the State.
This is their report, tabled on 2 September 2010"
859,Evaluation of the Queensland Murri Court: Final report,"&nbsp;

There have been a variety of innovative court models introduced, piloted and implemented across Australia to improve the effectiveness of the criminal justice system in dealing with specific offender populations. Indigenous sentencing courts have been established in most Australian jurisdictions in order to reduce high rates of reoffending among Indigenous offenders and to provide a more culturally-appropriate criminal justice process for Indigenous Australians that increases the involvement and confidence of the Indigenous community in the courts.

There are a growing number of evaluations investigating the operation and effectiveness of these court models. These are important because they can provide policymakers, judiciary and court partners with an evidence base upon which to make decisions regarding the expansion, improvement and development of both new and existing court programs.

This report presents the findings from the Australian Institute of Criminology’s (AIC) comprehensive evaluation of the Queensland Murri Court, undertaken with the support and assistance of a range of stakeholders involved in the program.

861,Childhood obesity: An economic perspective,"&nbsp;

Key points


	The weight of Australian children has increased markedly in recent decades, to the point where around 8 per cent are defined as obese (based on Body Mass Index), and 17 per cent as overweight.
	While the prevalence of obesity may have levelled off since the mid 1990s, it is still widely considered to be too high.
	Childhood obesity has been linked to a raft of physical and psychosocial health problems, including type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, as well as social stigmatisation and low self-esteem.
	Simply put, obesity results from an imbalance between energy consumed and expended. But the underlying causes are complex and difficult to disentangle.
	
		An economic perspective considers how individuals respond to changes in incentives, and how they make decisions involving tradeoffs between different consumption and exercise choices, including how they spend their time.
	
	
	Governments need to consider a range of issues in addressing childhood obesity.
	
		Most of the costs of obesity are borne by the obese themselves and their families.
		Market incentives to provide information about the causes and prevention of obesity are weak, creating a role for government. But unlike alcohol and tobacco consumption, the externalities (spillovers on unrelated third parties) associated with obesity are probably minor.
		Behavioural limitations can influence how people use available information about preventing obesity — even when it is available — and their responses to incentives and tradeoffs. Children are particularly susceptible to these limitations and have difficulty taking into account the future consequences of their actions.
		Obesity prevalence varies across the socioeconomic profile of the community, such that there can be important distributional issues.
		The obese also consume a disproportionate share of medical services, which, equity considerations aside, adds to the costs of our public health system.
	
	
	There is only limited evidence of interventions designed to address childhood obesity achieving their goals.
	
		This could reflect the inherent complexities and the multiple causes of obesity.
		But it might also reflect poor policy design and evaluation deficiencies.
	
	
	Notwithstanding the lack of evidence of interventions reducing obesity, some studies suggest that they can positively influence children\u27s eating behaviours and levels of physical activity, which in turn might influence obesity over time.
	The complex nature of the problem suggests that policies need to be carefully designed to maximise cost-effectiveness, and trialled, with a focus on evidence gathering, information sharing, evaluation and consequent policy modification.

862,Environmental crime in Australia,"&nbsp;

Environmental crime is the perpetration of harms against the environment that violate current law. The term environmental harm is often interchanged with environmental crime and, for some, any activity that has a deleterious effect on the environment is considered an environmental crime. At the other end of the spectrum, the harm may be conceived of as a crime per se only if it is subject to criminal prosecution and criminal sanction.

The activities that are recognised in Australia as environmental crimes include:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * pollution or other contamination of air, land and water;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * illegal discharge and dumping of, or trade in, hazardous and other regulated waste;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * illegal trade in ozone-depleting substances;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * illegal trade in (protected) flora and fauna and harms to biodiversity;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * illegal logging and timber trade;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * illegal native vegetation clearance; and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * water theft.

Compared with other crimes, environmental crime has taken longer to be accepted as a genuine category of crime. Changing perceptions about the vulnerability of the environment, particularly with respect to long-term outcomes of environmentally harmful practices, has altered this view to the extent that most behaviour with a potential environmental consequence is now tightly regulated.

Environmental crime has received some research attention in Australia but little in the way of a comprehensive account. This report aims to address this by assembling the available literature to examine the nature and extent of environmental crime in Australia and the laws and other processes in place to prevent, deter and sanction environmental offences"
863,An integrated approach to early childhood development,"Major social, demographic and economic changes in Australia over the last 50 years have dramatically altered the conditions in which families are raising children. There is evidence that a significant number of children are facing worsening developmental and social outcomes as a result of this ‘social climate change’.

The paper includes: a synthesis of evidence regarding societal change and its impact on children, families and communities; the response of governments to these changes; and what is known about effective
services, service systems and government policies. The paper also includes a review of evidence regarding integrated service delivery, service systems and policies, and an analysis of current opportunities in NSW and Queensland for greater service integration.

This paper was prepared by the Centre for Community Child Health, and commissioned by The Benevolent Society (TBS) to provide advice on how to move towards greater integration of the various elements of support and / or services needed by children and their families.

864,Dementia risk reduction: What do Australians know?,"&nbsp; Dementia has a significant impact on our health care system and this is set to increase. In Australia  and worldwide, the prevalence of dementia is expected to rise rapidly as the population ages. By 2050, there is predicted to be well over 100 million people living with a diagnosis of dementia. However, a number of modifiable risk factors have consistently been shown to be associated with dementia. There is converging evidence that mental stimulation, social engagement, healthy eating, exercise and prevention or treatment of cardiovascular risk factors may reduce the risk of developing dementia. This paper examines surveys of the general public that included questions related to dementia risk reduction. The findings suggest there is poor knowledge of the current evidence for dementia risk reduction. This paper not only highlights the need to raise awareness that it is possible to reduce the risk of dementia and also the need to educate Australians about the link between cardiovascular risk factors and an increased risk of dementia"

866,The experience of using fringe lenders in Queensland,"&nbsp;

This research examined the experiences of people accessing the alternative finance sector in Queensland. The focus of the research was on high cost, short-term loans, known traditionally as ‘payday loans’. The project utilised surveys and interviews with borrowers, lenders and other industry stakeholders including regulators and consumer advocates. The twelve month project, conducted during 2009, piloted a methodology now employed in a larger project that will examine fringe lending in NSW, Queensland and Victoria.&nbsp;

867,Policing ethnic minority groups with procedural justice,"&nbsp;

Public cooperation with police is essential for the effective management of crime and disorder in our society. Understanding factors that shape public cooperation with the police is therefore important. However, Australian and international studies show that police find it difficult to elicit cooperation from ethnic communities, this made difficult by the fact that ethnic groups display low levels of trust and confidence in the police. This study examines the role that procedural justice might play in fostering minority group perceptions of police legitimacy and their willingness to cooperate with police officers. The study uses survey data collected from Australian citizens and tests whether procedurally fair policing can enhance public cooperation among ethnic minority group members. Results indicate that cooperation appears to be mediated by people\u27s perceptions of police legitimacy. The findings have implications for theories of cooperation, as well as for determining how the police can foster better relationships with ethnically diverse communities.

868,"Innovation, technology diffusion and poverty traps: the role of valuable skills","&nbsp;

This paper develops a new index of human capital that measures cognitive skills employed by the adult population in seventy nations during 1970-2003.&nbsp; The index is compared to existing measures of human capital in the Benhabib and Spiegel (2005) model. Analysis goes beyond the Cobb-Douglas production function. The evidence shows that (i) the new index best explains trends in technology growth; (ii) the skills-education deficit has increased in Africa and advanced OECD countries; (iii) the number of countries in poverty traps has risen; and (iv) valuable skills impact most on innovation when physical capital and skills are complementary. The results suggest that public policy ought to pay more attention to the employability of skills"
869,Family violence and family law in Australia,"This report was commissioned by the Commonwealth Attorney-General\u27s Department in early 2009 to examine the impact of family violence, which had occurred before, during and or after parental relationship breakdown, on post-separation decision making and arrangements as viewed by children and parents. More specifically the brief was to discover parents’ and children’s perspectives on:
1. The effect that a history of or existence of violence within the relationship has on the decisions that people make about accessing the courts and dispute resolution services
2. The effect that a history of or the existence of violence within the relationship has on the decisions people make while they are at court and at dispute resolution services
3. The effect that a history of or the existence of violence within the relationship has on post-separation parenting arrangements.
The project surveyed a broad sample of parents and children to examine how family violence has affected their access to courts and dispute resolution services, and post-separation parenting arrangements.

874,An ethnographic study of the day-to-day lives and identities of people who are homeless in Brisbane,"People who are homeless are portrayed to be a distinct type of ‘homeless person’. Within scholarly research literature, their state of homelessness has been presented as informative of who they are. On both an individual and collective level, people without homes are ascribed with identities on the basis of their homelessness. Their voices and perspectives rarely contribute to broader knowledge about who they are as people. As such, the imposed ‘homeless identity’ has the consequence of positioning them as ‘other’ than the ‘normal’ people with homes.Using an ethnographic approach, this study aims to understand the day-to-day lives and identities of people who are homeless. Approximately one hundred people who slept and interacted within inner suburban Brisbane’s public places participated in this research. To learn about how they lived and who they saw themselves as individuals, I observed them, socialised with them, engaged them in informal conversations and formal interviews. This approach to fieldwork, conducted over a six month period, provided me with the opportunity to witness diverse aspects of daily lives. Further, the ethnographic engagement enabled a consideration of the ways people enacted and displayed different aspects of their identities across different social and physical places.
For the individuals who participated in this study, there was a stark distinction between how they lived, on the one hand, and the type of people they identified themselves as, on the other. They were comfortable describing their lives in ways that deviated from what they saw as the ‘mainstream’, but at the same time, they aligned themselves with this ‘mainstream’. Research participants expressed a strong view that their experiences of homelessness did not offer any purchase in explaining who they were, and how they thought about the world.
The public places in which they lived were perceived as problematic. Public places were dangerous and the site of unwanted interactions. Although living in public places meant that interactions and friendships with other people who were homeless was a reality, these interactions did not constitute a ‘homeless collective’. More fundamentally,however, living in public places meant having no legitimate places, and having limited capacity to control day-to-day lives.The participants in this research articulated stereotypical notions of what home meant to them – home was a physical structure, a house. Similarly, home was a solution to their lives as homeless. Their constructions of home can also be seen as symbolic of their aspirations to find their ‘place’, and engage in the ‘mainstream’ society they feel disconnected from.While public places were associated with limited control over daily lives, the people in this research also exercised agency in enacting different aspects of their identities. Mediated by the social and physical constraints within their environment, they displayed an awareness of social expectations and emphasised elements of the self to achieve specific ends.Identities matter. An understanding of the identities of people experiencing homelessness, from their perspectives, can contribute toward the development of homelessness practice and policy responses. A distinction is made between solving problems people may have and solving homelessness. In terms of the latter, the thesis concludes that the provision of ‘normal’ housing and the availability of support, as distinct from mandatory engagement with case management, is the most appropriate response to the needs of the people who participated in this research"
875,The coming of environmental authoritarianism,"The East Asian region generally and Southeast Asia in particular have long been associated with authoritarian rule. Mark Beeson argues that the intensification of a range of environmental problems means that authoritarian rule is likely to become even more commonplace there in the future.  Countries with limited state capacity will struggle to deal with the consequences of population expansion, economic development and the environmental degradation with which they are associated. A resurgence of&nbsp; authoritarian rule is made even more likely by China’s ‘successful’ developmental example and the extent of the region’s existing environmental problems. The dispiriting reality may be that authoritarian regimes – unattractive as they may be – may even prove more capable of responding to the complex political and environmental pressures in the region than some of its democracies"

Attorney-General Robert McClelland ordered the review in August 2008 after retired customs officer Allan Kessing was charged with disclosing information without due authorisation. A key focus of the ALRC report is to wind back the use of criminal sanctions, for the unauthorised disclosure of information, including the repeal of s 70 of the Crimes Act 1914, which has attracted consistent criticism over the years.
The Final Report makes 61 recommendations for reform and sets out a new and principled framework designed to reinforce open and accountable government while ensuring adequate protection for Commonwealth information that should legitimately be kept confidential.
The ALRC recommends that every Australian Government agency should develop and publish information-handling policies and guidelines to clarify the application of secrecy laws.

880,The effects of education and health on wages and productivity,"Human capital theory supports the view that people with higher levels of education and lower incidences of chronic illness should have higher labour productivity. This paper examines the Australian evidence.

Hourly wages can be used as an indicator of labour productivity. While wages are likely to be a reasonable indicator of the effects of education on labour productivity, statistical issues and the way that labour markets function in practice mean that using wages as an indicator could lead to results that under- or overstate the negative effects of ill health on labour productivity.

In this paper, higher levels of education are estimated to be associated with significantly higher wages. Compared to a person with a year 11 education or less, on average:

• a man with a year 12 education earns around 13 per cent more, and a woman earns around 10 per cent more
• a man with a diploma or certificate earns around 14 per cent more, and a woman earns around 11 per cent more
•a university education adds around 40 per cent to men\u27s and women\u27s earnings.

People in the workforce who suffer from chronic illnesses are estimated to earn slightly less than their healthy counterparts (between 1.0 per cent and 5.4 per cent less for a range of conditions).It is possible that these results understate the impact of ill health on productivity, because of the impact that one person\u27s illness can have on other employees. It is also possible that \u27endogeneity bias\u27 and unobserved heterogeneity in the data lead to results that overstate the positive effects of education and good health on labour productivity.

A second objective of this paper is to estimate the potential productivity of people who are not employed or not in the labour force. These people tend to have characteristics that are systematically different to people who are employed. For example, they tend to have less education and work experience, and also to be in worse health. Because of this, they are more likely to be targeted by government programs.

Comparison of the characteristics of people in employment with those not in employment found that, depending on their age, gender and whether they receive the Disability Support Pension, the average potential wage of people who are not employed or not in the labour force is between 65 and 75 per cent of the wage of people who are employed.

883,"Aboriginal spirituality: Aboriginal philosophy, the basis of Aboriginal social and emotional wellbeing","This discussion paper argues for the centrality of Aboriginal Spirituality in the practice of social and emotional wellbeing and for applications in all areas of Aboriginal development. 
Although often mentioned in the literature on Aboriginal health and social and emotional wellbeing, Spirituality has been in danger of becoming one of the undefined terms—like wellbeing, community, identity—that are used in various contexts and with various meanings attached, and in ways that obscure the reality of Indigenous Australian knowledges, philosophies and practices. In common with terms such as the Dreaming, it has lost significant meaning when translated into English.
This discussion paper importantly defines Aboriginal Spirituality by privileging the voices of Aboriginal people themselves and those of well-respected observers of Aboriginal culture. It demonstrates how those who are well exemplify Spirituality in everyday life and cultural expression. Having commonalities with international Indigenous groups, it is also deeply appreciated by non-Aboriginal people who understand and value the different ontologies (understandings of what it means to be), epistemologies (as ways of knowing) and axiologies (the bases of values and ethics) that Aboriginal philosophy embodies, as potential value to all peoples.
Spirituality includes Indigenous Australian knowledges that have informed ways of being, and thus wellbeing, since before the time of colonisation, ways that have been subsequently demeaned and devalued. Colonial processes have wrought changes to this knowledge base and now Indigenous Australian knowledges stand in a very particular relationship of critical dialogue with those introduced knowledges that have oppressed them.
Spirituality is the philosophical basis of a culturally derived and wholistic concept of personhood, what it means to be a person, the nature of relationships to others and to the natural and material world, and thus represents strengths and difficulties facing those who seek to assist Aboriginal Australians to become well.
This discussion paper questions the advisability of approaches that incorporate an Aboriginal perspective or cultural awareness as an overlay to the Western practices of dealing with mental health issues. Western practices have developed out of an entirely different concept of personhood, development of the individual and relationships to the wider world, and further research in this area, particularly incorporating the voices of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, is critical to ways forward"
884,A framework of practice for implementing a kinship care program,"The aim of this study is to provide a framework to guide the implementation of statutory kinship services by the Benevolent Society. The countries included in the study are Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Norway, United Kingdom and United States of America.&nbsp; In the first stage of the study the key focus of the study was on consultations with stakeholders and reviewing the literature on models and tools exemplifying ‘good’, ‘best’ or ‘promising’ practice in kinship care. Given the lack of evidence base around many of the models and tools discussed in this report the advantages and disadvantages of most models and tools, at this stage, is judged to be speculative. The emphasis in the report therefore is on promising practices and key messages from the field.&nbsp; The second stage of the study involved four focus groups with kinship carers. The aim of the groups was to obtain the perspectives of kinship carers in relation to a number of specific aspects of kinship care. The main aspects of kinship care reviewed in the literature, and considered by stakeholders and carers in the focus groups, included:&nbsp; • family group conferencing; • carer assessment;&nbsp; • carer training; • carer support (financial) • carer support (non-financial); • contact and access; and • carer support groups. Attention was also paid in the study to research around birth parents of children in kinship placements, children in kinship care, and training for workers in kinship care.&nbsp; Image: Sanctuary photography → !!? / Flick"
885,"Cities, climate change and multilevel governance","Cities represent a challenge and an opportunity for climate change policy. As the hubs of economic activity, cities generate the bulk of greenhouse gas emissions and are thus important to mitigation strategies. Urban planning will shape future trends and the concentration of population, socio-economic activity, poverty and infrastructure in urban areas translates into particular vulnerability to increased climate hazards. City governments and urban stakeholders will therefore be essential in the design and delivery of cost-effective adaptation policies. Further, by empowering local governments, national policies could leverage existing local experiments, accelerate policy responses, foster resource mobilization and engage local stakeholders.

This paper presents a framework for multilevel governance, showing that advancing governance of climate change across all levels of government and relevant stakeholders is crucial to avoid policy gaps between local action plans and national policy frameworks (vertical integration) and to encourage crossscale learning between relevant departments or institutions in local and regional governments (horizontal dimension). Vertical and horizontal integration allows two-way benefits: locally-led or bottom-up where local initiatives influence national action and nationally-led or top-down where enabling frameworks empower local players. The most promising frameworks combine the two into hybrid models of policy dialogue where the lessons learnt are used to modify and fine-tune enabling frameworks and disseminated horizontally, achieving more efficient local implementation of climate strategies.

Such integration generates benefits at all stages of the policy process. This includes agenda setting and strategic planning, to encourage political leadership and stakeholders\u27 support; policy formulation and approval to promote long-term vision and near term action; local implementation to overcome obstacles, build necessary capacity, and establish reliable financing for action; feedback and evaluation; and dissemination to promote information sharing and cross-scale learning.

A review of current practices suggests the need for national governments to help create a sound institutional foundation and knowledge base to support decision making and action at local levels. This includes developing harmonized GHG inventory methods for local government use, boundary organisations to generate regional science-policy or economic-policy information, and developing strong urban climate policy networks. Making such tools available will help local governments to design, implement and refine policies to find cost-effective climate policy solutions and drive economic development in green sectors. It will also help national governments to deliver on ambitious climate policy goals in the coming decades.

886,Looking inside the perpetual-motion machine: job and worker flows in OECD countries,"This paper looks at the factors that influence the rate at which jobs and workers \u27flow\u27 through a number of western economies, and identifies significant differences between European countries and Britain and the US.

In the economic literature there is an increasing interest in the process of job creation and destruction as well of hirings and separations. Many studies suggest that idiosyncratic firm-level characteristics shape both job and worker flows in a similar way in all countries. Others argue that cross-country differences in terms of gross job flows are minor. However, these statements are usually based on the comparison of national estimates, typically collected on the basis of different definitions and collection protocols. By contrast, this paper uses cross-country comparable data on both job and worker flows to examine key determinants of these flows and of their cross-country differences.

The authors find that idiosyncratic firm (industry, firm age and size) and worker (age, gender, education) characteristics play an important role for both gross job and worker flows in all countries. Nevertheless, in contrast with part of the literature, they find that, even controlling for these idiosyncratic factors, cross-country differences concerning both gross job and worker flows appear large and of a similar magnitude. Both job and worker flows in countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom exceed those in certain continental European countries by a factor of two.

Moreover, the variation of worker flows across different dimensions is well explained by the variation of job flows, suggesting that, to a certain extent, the two flows can be used as substitutes in cross-country analysis. Consistently, churning flows, that is flows originating by firms churning workers and employees quitting and being replaced, display much less variation across countries"
887,Young people and technology,"This literature review by Adjunct Professor Helen McGrath of RMIT School of Education informs the development of The Alannah and Madeline Foundation\u27s Cybersafety and Wellbeing Initiative. Cyberbullying, sexual predation, accessing inappropriate content, being coerced into sending sexually suggestive images, and identity fraud are some of the cyberspace risks facing young people today.   Recent research reveals that approximately 10% of Australian students in years 4-9 have experienced cyberbullying.   A number of children and young people will be targeted by an online predator or paedophile each year.   \u27Sexting\u27 (where nude or sexual images are sent as picture messages via mobile phones) is on the rise among young people, with most not thinking about the future consequences.   Many young people share their username and password with friends, and can find their user accounts misused when the friendship turns sour.   Children can be particularly vulnerable to marketing offers they \u27sign up\u27 to that result in a torrent of spam, or ongoing charges for the downloads they can\u27t control.   Parents and teachers are often too unfamiliar with cyberspace to offer credible advice to young people about the risks online and how to avoid them"

The report will inform the work already underway on national professional teaching standards, a national professional learning framework and the professional learning needs of teachers in the lead up to the implementation of the new National Curriculum"
889,The geography of creativity,"Although there is an increasing recognition of the positive role that creative industries play in innovation and growth, there is little evidence on the spatial dimension of this impact. An ongoing NESTA project employs economic geography techniques to address this gap, with the aim of improving our understanding of the mechanisms through which creative industries contribute to regional innovative performance, and to inform the development of policies to support these linkages.

This interim report presents the results of the first stage of this research. The authors map the presence of creative firms across Britain as a first step towards establishing their impact on regional innovation at a second stage of the
project.

The mapping effort is informed by the influential concept of ‘industrial clusters’"
890,Primary health care reform in Australia,"This report provides background to the Draft National Primary Health Care Strategy as well as providing evidence to support future investment in, and reform of, the primary health care system. 

The report also examines key issues that were raised under the ten individual Elements of the National Primary Health Care Strategy discussion paper, Towards a National Primary Health Care Strategy, which was publicly released on 30 October 2008.

The draft strategy, Building a 21st Century Primary Health Care System, is available here"
891,Culture and creative learning: a literature review,"This report examines the idea of culture as it has permeated policy-making, public debate, practices in schools and academic writing in the UK.This review focuses on debates that have occurred in and around English education since 1944. It tracks a sequence of intense and continuing arguments about the proper meanings of ‘culture’ and ‘creativity’, about their salience to education, and, through education, to wider issues of equality, democracy, economics and emancipation.
Who are the participants in these arguments? In the 30 years after 1944, the review identifies three main currents of thought and practice:

a cultural conservatism for which tradition and authority are important reference points; 
a progressivism concerned with child-centred learning; 
and a tendency whose belief that ‘culture is ordinary’ led to an insistence that working-class and popular culture should be represented in the classroom.

894,Involving children and young people in research,"Involving children and young people in participatory research can be of great benefit to the young participants as well as to researchers. However that involvement also raises a number of ethical and access challenges.

Involving Children and Young People in Research is a compendium of papers that seek to define and address those challenges within the broader context of changing attitudes toward the right of children and young people to play an active role in the decisions and actions that shape their lives. The compendium is one result of a symposium held in November 2008, co-hosted by ARACY and the NSW Commission for Children and Young People. The Think Tank brought together leaders in the field of participatory research to share their experience and identify what works and what doesn’t work in research that is with and by children – as well as for and about them.

895,Stronger families in Australia study: the impact of communities for children,"This report presents the results of the evaluation of the short-run impacts of the Communities for Children (CfC) initiative on child, family and community outcomes. The study was based on a three-wave longitudinal study of 2,202 families living in 10 sites that had a CfC program and five sites comparable to the CfC sites (contrast sites).

The first wave collected baseline data, Wave 2 was conducted during the implementation phase of the CfC and Wave 3 was conducted in 2008 approximately one year after the CfC program was underway.

The aim of the study was to measure changes in child, family and community outcomes in CfC communities over the funding period.

The study found evidence that CfC had positive impacts including:


	fewer children were living in a jobless household
	parents reported less hostile or harsh parenting practices
	parents felt more effective in their roles as parents"
896,Review of secrecy laws: discussion paper,"This paper considers the best legal arragements to ensure a balance between the need to protect some Commonwealth information and the need to maintain an open and accountable government through providing appropriate access to information.
The ALRC has identified and considered 507 secrecy provisions scattered across 175 pieces of legislation, including 358 distinct secrecy offences carrying a wide variety of criminal penalties. This discussion paper indicates the inquiry’s current thinking in the form of specific reform proposals. In trying to move towards a more open and ‘pro-disclosure culture’, the ALRC proposes a substantial decrease in the use of criminal sanctions – limiting prosecutions to those unauthorised disclosures in which it is alleged that harm has been caused, or was likely to be caused, to a compelling public interest. In most cases, however, the ALRC proposes that concerns about the protection of Commonwealth information should be addressed through better education and training, improved information handling practices, and public service disciplinary procedures.
The proposals contained in DP&nbsp;74 do not represent the final recommendations of the Inquiry. The ALRC is seeking further submissions and is undertaking a further round of national consultations on the proposals in DP&nbsp;74. It is not uncommon for there to be some significant changes of approach between a Discussion Paper and Final Report"
897,Gaps in Australia&#039;s Indigenous language policy: dismantling bilingual education in the Northern Territory,"Young children learn best when taught through their mother tongue. This commonsense principle has been supported by decades of research on bilingual education for children who don\u27t speak the dominant language. The research has also shown that there are positive effects on children’s cognitive development if they are encouraged to become strong bilinguals.

For Indigenous communities, bilingual education has been highly valued not only because it helps children maintain Indigenous languages, but also because it provides an honoured place for Indigenous languages in the curriculum and an honoured place for Indigenous teachers. However, in the Northern Territory bilingual education has been a controversial issue since its inception in the 1970s. In part this is due to the failure of policy-makers to recognise that children who are monolingual in a language other than English need explicit teaching of the English language, by trained English as a Second Language (ESL) or English as a Foreign Language (EFL) teachers, before they can learn through English as the medium of instruction. Consequently, there has been much political debate on the issue and frequent moves against bilingual education.

At the end of 2008 the Northern Territory Government, supported by the Commonwealth Government, all but closed bilingual education in remote Indigenous schools by determining that the language of instruction for the first four hours of school must be English. This decision could spell the death of the remaining endangered Indigenous languages in Australia. Yet it was taken without apparent regard for the evidence from research on how monolingual children learn a second language, or on the positive value of bilingual education, or the language rights of Indigenous peoples, or the evidence from schools which had abandoned bilingual education.

This paper argues that the policy gap revealed by this event should be filled by a national commitment to serious consideration of evidence, and recognition of Indigenous language rights. Through national and international evidence this discussion paper outlines the cognitive, societal and education benefits of bilingual education for children whose first language is not English. It is anticipated that this paper will stimulate political discussion on using evidence-based research to improve education for Australia’s Indigenous children"

900,The CPRS: Economic cost without environmental benefit - interim report,"The committee recommends that the government reconsider its proposed approach to how Australia can best contribute to a reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions.

On 25 June 2008, the Senate established the Senate Select Committee on Fuel and Energy (the committee) to inquire into and report on the impact of higher petroleum, diesel and gas prices and several related matters.

As the terms of reference are broad, the committee has decided to report in stages. This interim report addresses the following part of the inquiry\u27s terms of reference:
The impact of an emissions trading scheme on the fuel and energy industry, including but not limited to:
(i) prices,
(ii) employment in the fuel and energy industries, and any related
adverse impacts on regional centres reliant on these industries,
(iii) domestic energy supply, and
(iv) future investment in fuel and energy infrastructure.

901,Public infrastructure financing,"This study explores the scope for efficient financing to reduce the life-time cost of an infrastructure project and the potential of financing vehicles to improve the investment decision.&nbsp; It does not attempt an overall comparative assessment of financing vehicles - many legal, institutional, market environment and project specific factors have to be weighed in making such judgements. Instead, it reports on the experiences of a number of countries following different approaches to help provide an assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the different options"
902,Strengthening and repairing relationships: Addressing forgiveness and sacrifice in couples education and counselling,"For many years, couples research has focused a great deal on marital distress and dissolution and, in particular, the types, frequency and management of conflict. However, some researchers are suggesting that there are limitations to the efforts being made to understand couple relationships through a narrow conflict lens. In a 2007 article in the Journal of Marriage and Family, three noted relationships scholars suggested that the accumulating evidence on conflict in relationships shows that it may be less central to long-term relationship outcomes than has been thought. They suggested that a richer understanding of couple relationships might be gained by moving the focus of research towards examining the ""larger meanings and deeper motivations about relationships"" and the positive constructs underlying behaviours and attitudes that help to strengthen and repair a relationship (Fincham, Stanley, &amp; Beach, 2007, p. 276; see also Stanley, 2007; Stanley &amp; Markman, 1998). Fincham et al. also suggested that, in taking this broader view, further mechanisms for understanding relationships may be revealed, although constructs relating to the more positive aspects of relationships seem to be more difficult to investigate. Their suggestion of shifting the focus of relationships research was met with cautious enthusiasm by a number of relationships scholars.

Nevertheless, intuitively it makes sense that studying the constructs that are manifest in a range of pro-relationship behaviours and attitudes is likely to contribute to our understanding of the complexities of couple relationships. These investigations would also build on other major shifts in the focus of relationships researchers in recent years, such as the highly productive application of attachment theory to adult intimate relationships, from which therapeutic applications have also been developed. Such a move would also reflect a broader shift towards viewing relationships in terms of their strengths and wellbeing rather than deficits and distress, also evident in both research and public policy (see, for example, Ooms &amp; Wilson, 2004).

This ""shift"" per se is not the primary focus of this paper. Rather, it is concerned with the notion that better understanding of relational dynamics can be gained through studying constructs that contribute to the strength of a relationship"
