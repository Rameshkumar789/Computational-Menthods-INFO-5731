              "['It has been said often but apparently not often enough that in transport things cannot go on as they have before. The current UK government has made many steps in rejecting the myth of the great car economy but the performance of their policies has been ambiguous. Associated with traffic congestion are the related problems of air pollution emissions of CO 2 and other greenhouse gases together with more subtle lifestyle effects such as contributing to less healthy lifestyles and transport poverty. Conclusions from many studies have supported the idea of implementing policy packages. Whether it is termed as policy packages or integrated strategies this study does not make a distinction strategically exemplified integration in five different ways. In Scotland the Integrated Transport Bill TSO included proposals for congestion charging. This form of learning will involve a coevolutionary learning that will draw in the partners and actors involved in the scheme but also third parties like governments that can help in the institutional and societal embedding. In the UK context this has been illustrated recently in the Eddington report. Some academics have reported thoroughly the unsustainability of current transport practices. The topic of merging policy measures into policy packages has been previously addressed. A recent action by the UK government was the creation of the Transport Innovation Fund to support experiments with a package of policies including road pricing',\n",
              " 'Concentric microdialysis probes incorporating a recording electrode AN69 Hospal membrane 025mm outer diameter Ã 1mm fiber length type MEH1 Applied Neuroscience Ltd London UK were implanted in the frontoparietal cortex coordinates 13 to 15 mm anterior to bregma 2 mm lateral and 14 to 15 mm deep from the cortical surface and held in place with ac rylic dental cement embedding two small stainlesssteel skull screws used as anchor. Indeed druginduced changes in arterial blood pressure could have altered the magnitude of hyperperfusion associated with K induced increase in brain energy demand thereby influencing acidâbase homeostasis and acidosis is known to inhibit both NMDAreceptor function and CSD. To minimize any possible interference of halothane anesthesia with the processes under study once the surgical procedure had been completed the depth of anesthesia was carefully controlled by monitoring the EEG and arterial blood pressure and the concentration of halothane in the breathing mixture kept to a minimum 15 to 175. It is relevant to note that halothane did not interfere with neuronal NOSmediated control of CBF in a previous study. These electrophysiologic variables were derived from the potential between the electrode built into the microdialysis probe and a silversilver chloride reference electrode placed under the scalp. Previous studi es showed that such a high concentration of K is required to evoke consistent periodic CSD under these experimental conditions possibly because of the efficient uptake of K by brain cells and because a minimum volume of tissue approximately 1 mm 3 has to be depolarized for successful CSD elicitation. The range of Larginine concentrations tested was reversed ie highest concentration applied first because LNAME has a much higher affinity for NOS than Larginine and series 1 showed that the effects of LNAME on CSD persisted for more than 40 minutes. As in previous studies drug effects on the cortex susceptibility to repeated CSD elicited by K series 1 were assessed through the a nalysis of changes in the following variables number of CSD elicited N cumulative CSD area A in millivolts Ã minute and latency for occurrence of first CSD L in minutes. As in previous studies based on the same experimental protocol the subsequent K stimuli were progressively less effective in triggering CSD as shown by the reduced number of CSD elicited reduced cumulative area and prolonged latency bar charts. Indeed each CSD is followed by a refractory period during which the elicitation of subsequent CSD is inhibited and the refractory period is likely to be prolonged by longerlasting CSD as a result of more pronounced disruption of cellular ionic homeostasis and metabolism. In other terms the full effect of the concentration of LNAME tested on CSD required its application in association with a previous CSD thus suggesting activationdependent inhibition of NOS or the presence of preformed pools of NOcontaining factors',\n",
              " 'Conversely MMP11 expression is related to local lymph node tumor invasion. This observation is in agreement with previous studies of cutaneous and oral SCC in which MMP10 was not associated with malignant cell invasion. However as the number of MMPs identifie d and their respective substrates has grown a sequential numbering system for their identity is now being adopted and the MMPs are now grouped according to their structure. All MMPs are produced as inactive zymogens proMMPs which must be subsequently activated by removal of the propeptide domain to generate catalytically active MMPs. Unlike several other MMPs that are localised predominantly in tumor stroma tumor cells themselv es appear to express MMP10. A central role for MMP10 in this process is demonstrated by its ability to cleave several proMMPs including MMP1 MMP7 MMP8 MMP9 and MMP13. In order that a tumor may grow spread and metastasise it must possess the ability to breakdown and degrade both the extracellular matrix ECM and basement membranes promote an angiogenic response evade immune surveillance and avoid elimination. Activation of MMPs is regulated at two levels within tissues transcriptionally in response Abbreviations NSCLC non small cell lung carcinoma MMP matrix metalloproteinase Address all correspondence to Dr Jason H Gill Cancer Research UK Laboratories and proteolytically at the level of proMMP activation. Once secreted and activated MMP activity is regulated in situ by endogenous inhibitors termed tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase TIMPs. The observation that MMP3 is expressed throughout the majority of these tumors suggested that it may be a central regulator of local growth of the neoplastic cell mass. Although MMP10 is closely related to MMP3 with respect to structure and substrate specificity differences in inducibility activity and cellular distribution exist suggesting distinct roles for both MMP3 and MMP10',\n",

A recent survey by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions found that 29 percent of women and 28 percent of men reported that their work was causing them stress. The deficiency of strategic level intervention studies has been an impediment to improving our knowledge of workrelated stress. It is widely recognised that stress is dynamic and therefore within an organisational context it needs to be continually evaluated and reviewed if organisations are to sustain and develop employee health and well being. The effects of workrelated stress both to individuals and organisations are extensive. Work organisation and work surroundings may inhibit employees from efficiently carrying out their daily responsibilities and can subject individuals to hazardous situations. This practice enables participants to take charge over emotional behaviours. Limiting uncertainty through strategic planning and communicating effectively any aspects of organisational change are the foundations of organisational effectiveness. These include Apart from specific Acts of Parliament recent common law cases have highlighted the employers du ty of care to protect employees from personal injury resulting from psychiatric damage and of potential legal liability if they fail to fulfil their obligations. There is now increasing interest for stress to be investigated from an organisational perspective so that it can be dealt with at the environmental level too. These can be referred to as primary secondary and tertiary levels of stress intervention',\n",

The European Standard population age bands were used based on previous epidemiological research. Previously he had visited a pir visiting from Pakistan who had diagnosed the problem as saya literally meaning shadow â the belief that some evil spirit or individual has cast his or her shadow on the patient and given him some verses to read in Farsi. The United Kingdom UK in common with other western societies is characterised by a plural health care system comprising the dominant biomedical sector with services delivered through the National Health Service NHS and by private providers and a growing sector of socall ed complementary and alternative therapies CAM delivered by an array of mainly private providers although there is increasing collaboration and interpenetration between the two sectors. In the context of Bradford a city in the north of England in which the study was undertaken we can add a third sector that of traditional South Asian therapists operating in parallel to but separately from the other two and without the global reach of biomedicine or global CAM. Epilepsy might be considered a prime candidate for the use of CAM as it is a chronic condition for which there is no medical cure which may be medically intractable or for which conventional medication in the form of anticonvulsive drugs may offer only partial control. Studies have shown that in western countries a significant proportion of people with epilepsy use CAM specifically for epilepsy usually in conjunction with rather than in place of conventional anticonvulsive therapy and often without telling their doctors. Religious grouping provides a robust framework for reflecting some of this diversity and to a large extent can be correlated with socioeconomic position. Whether this is carried out by a conscientious lone researcher by a team or by involving independent experts is immaterial what matters is that a systematic process is followed. All those who had sought additional treatment had experienced continued seizures despite compliance with medication and many gave a sense of desperation as their main motivation',\n",
              " 'This is supported by the results of a study undertaken before the use of gloves by HCWs became common practice which reported that 15 of nurses working in an isolation unit carried a median of 10 4 cfu of S aureus on their hands and 29 of nurses working in a general hospital had a median count of 38 Ã 10 3 cfu. Hand hygiene is generally considered to be the most important measure that can be applied to prevent the spread of healthcareassociated infection HAI. While it is undoubtedly the case that improved hand hygiene is beneficial there is growing evidence that increased compliance may not yield the hoped for results. Accordingly Austin et al used values of p 040 and p 006 which equates to a combined p Ã p value of 0024. In a study of clean activities such as lifting patients palpation of pulses or during sphygmomanometry Casewell and Phillips found that nurses could contaminate their hands with 100â1000 colony forming units cfu of Klebsiella spp. Girou et al for example found that hand rubbing with a 75 alcoholbased solution resulted in a median percentage reduction in bacterial contamination of 83 compared with a reduction of only 58 when washing with medicated soap. In order to permit direct comparison with Cooper et al we used the same data and simulated the same general medical ward as they did. In keeping with Cooper et al we assumed the probability of a HCW contaminating their hands or a patient becoming colonized after each HCWpatient contact ie the transmissibility value to be 01. Again this confirms the findings of Cooper et al who found transmissibility to be the single most influential variable in their study. For example using dynamic transmission models Cooper et al and McBryde et al found that the law of diminishing returns applies to hand hygiene with the g reatest benefits occurring in the first 20 or so of compliance. Furthermore Austin et al and Beggs et al demonstrated that poor cohorting of nursing staff profoundly influences the effectiveness of hand hygiene measures',\n",

In the UK context this has been illustrated recently in the Eddington report. The current UK government has made many steps in rejecting the myth of the great car economy but the performance of their policies has been ambiguous. Associated with traffic congestion are the related problems of air pollution emissions of CO 2 and other greenhouse gases together with more subtle lifestyle effects such as contributing to less healthy lifestyles and transport poverty. Some academics have reported thoroughly the unsustainability of current transport practices. The topic of merging policy measures into policy packages has been previously addressed. Conclusions from many studies have supported the idea of implementing policy packages. Whether it is termed as policy packages or integrated strategies this study does not make a distinction strategically exemplified integration in five different ways. A recent action by the UK government was the creation of the Transport Innovation Fund to support experiments with a package of policies including road pricing. This document influenced policy and research and geared them towards the idea of an integrated transport system',\n",
